  title: "Machine learning models for analysis of behavior of Engineered Heart Tissues (EHTs)"
  author-title: "Białystok University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Nowadays, one of the most important issues is connected with preparation of new medications. Especially, it is hard when it comes to organs like human heart. It is not easy to appropriately test the medication without applying it to the organ. Such a procedure is extremely risky and can lead even to patient's death. To reduce that risk, scientists proposed to test the medication within synthetically grown tissues and even single cells. However, here we can observe another problem. To find some changes in the cell/tissue behavior (e.g., its stoppage), lab worker needs to observe the cell constantly through the microscope. It is hard, because such changes can be observed even after a couple of hours. It is why, the Author of that work would like to propose a procedure by which, the behavior of the cell can be automatically assigned in each second of its lifetime (also after application of new medication) – in real time. This procedure combines Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques – Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to recognize the stage of systole or diastole whilst methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) are consumed to detect the areas which take part in the process of contraction. Digital signal/image processing methods are also used to increase the quality of the image and visibility of the cell. It needs to be pointed out that all experiments were performed with the database of 3D videos (single cell is observable in the center of the scene). More than 50 videos were used to develop the proposed techniques. Obtained results were discussed with experienced biologists and bioengineers from Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Science (Poznań, Poland). On the basis of these discussions it was proven that the algorithm is precise and effective enough to be used in real biological experiments.

  title: "Are encoders able to learn landmarkers?"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning purposes is still an unsolved problem. Previous approaches rely on representations that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -- warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. The first involves deep metric learning, while the second is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed methods using efficiency in the target meta-task and using one method proposed by ourselves. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not directly translate to significant performance gains in HPO warm-starting.

  title: "Improving performance of distributed learning through density estimation."
  author-title: "PrecisionArt"
  abstract: >- 
    In domains like healthcare and military, training data is often distributed among independent clients who cannot share data due to privacy concerns or limited bandwidth. This scenario is typically addressed by federated learning, where a central server coordinates communication of models between clients. However, when a central server is absent, clients must train models in a distributed, peer-to-peer manner. Ongoing work by the Auton Lab is developing a novel approach based on function space regularization to train models in distributed fashion with low communication overhead. In their work, the authors have shown that for certain high dimensional data sets, the performance is far lower than that of a central model. It is partially due to the fact that function space regularization enforces agreement on the whole domain, which overly penalizes models for disagreeing on out of distribution data. To address this, issue, we propose an extension to the Distributed AI framework that leverages density estimates to appropriately weight the function space regularization by these estimates. We also show an example implementation using Gaussian Mixture Models and Decision Trees. Furthermore, we present benchmark results on popular machine learning data sets as well as synthetically created data sets.

  title: "Unrevealing Hidden Relations Between Latent Space and Image Generations in Diffusion Models"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing new images from random noise, but they lack meaningful latent space that encodes data into features. Recent DDPM-based editing techniques try to mitigate this issue by inverting images back to their approximated staring noise. In this work, we propose to study the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the samples generated from it, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the inversion procedure. First, we interpret their spatial distance relations to show the inaccuracy of the DDIM inversion technique by localizing latent representations manifold between the initial noise and generated samples. On top of this observation, we explain the nature of image interpolation and editing through linear combining of latent encodings, revealing the origin of their significant limitations. Finally, we demonstrate the peculiar relation between initial Gaussian noise and its corresponding generations during diffusion training, showing that the high-level features of generated images stabilize rapidly, keeping the spatial distance relationship between noises and generations consistent throughout the training.

  title: "Model fusion for multimodal prediction of plant species composition"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Prediction of plant species composition across space and time at a fine resolution is crucial for biodiversity management, inventarisation or creation of high-resolution maps. However, the annotation of large datasets with multi-label species information is resource intensive. The GeoLifeCLEF 2024 competition addresses this by posing a challenge of learning from a small amount of high quality presence-absence multi-label data and a large number of presence-only single-label samples. The training dataset consists of five million plant observations across Europe, supplemented by various environmental data such as remote sensing imagery, land cover, and climate variables.  To approach the multimodal aspect of the problem we propose an architecture utilizing feature fusion of Visual Transformer (ViT-B/32) and two convolutional networks (ResNet18). Each modality is processed by a network best suited for particular task and then concatenated into a single vector representing the combined features from all modalities. To address the issue of class imbalance arising from detecting a small number of species among numerous possibilities, we employ a focal loss function down-weighing the influence of easy negatives. This model fusion approach, which integrates multiple deep learning models, achieved promising results, securing 13th place in the GeoLifeCLEF CVPR 2024 competition.

  title: "Generating music with Large Language Models"
  author-title: "AGH University of Krakow"
  abstract: >- 
    The work is devoted to explore the possibilities of music generation using large languagemodels (LLM). The aim of the study is to analyze the architectures of language models and their application in the process of music creation. The paper focuses on the structural similarities between music and text, arguing that these two forms of expression share common sequential features, which allows the adaptation of language models for the generation of musical compositions. The paper also provides an overview of existing formats for digital representation of music that can be used to train generative models. By conductinga series of experiments using a variety of architectures, such as transformers and state space models, the effectiveness of different approaches in the context of music generation was analyzed. An attempt was made to evaluate the generated musical fragments using commercially available LLM models or those trained to understand music. The work offers new perspectives on the potential of LLM in the field of artificial musical creativity, paving the way for further research in this fascinating interdisciplinary space.

  title: "Region-constrained Visual Counterfactual Explanations"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    Visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs) have recently become widely recognized for their ability to enhance the interpretability of image classifiers. This surge in interest is driven by the potential of VCEs to highlight semantically relevant factors that can alter a classifier's decision. Nevertheless, we contend that current leading methods lack a critical feature – region constraint – which hinders the ability to draw clear conclusions and can even foster issues like confirmation bias. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, which alter images in a highly entangled and scattered fashion, we introduce region-constrained VCEs (RVCEs). These constraint modifications to a specific region of the image in order to influence the model's prediction. To efficiently generate examples from this subclass of VCEs, we present Region-Constrained Counterfactual Schrödinger Bridges (RCSB), which adapt a traceable subclass of Schrödinger Bridges to handle conditional inpainting, with the conditioning signal coming from the classifier of interest. Our approach not only establishes a new state-of-the-art, but also allows for exact counterfactual reasoning, ensuring that only the predefined region is semantically modified, and allows the user to interactively engage with the explanation generation process.

  title: "Adaptivee: Adaptive Ensemble for Tabular Data"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Ensemble methods are widely used to improve model performance by combining multiple models, each contributing uniquely to predictions. Traditional ensemble approaches often rely on static weighting schemes that do not account for the varying effectiveness of individual models across different subspaces of the data. This work introduces adaptivee, a dynamic ensemble framework designed to optimize performance for tabular data tasks by adjusting model weights in response to specific data characteristics. The adaptivee framework offers flexibility through various reweighting strategies, including emphasizing single models for subspace specialization or distributing importance among models for robustness. Experiments on the OpenML-CC18 benchmark demonstrate that adaptivee can significantly boost performance, achieving up to a 6% improvement in balanced accuracy over traditional static ensemble methods. This framework opens new avenues for advancing ensemble techniques, particularly in tabular data contexts where model complexity is constrained by the nature of the data.

  title: "When All Options Are Wrong: Evaluating Large Language Model Robustness with Incorrect Multiple-Choice Options"
  author-title: "Independent"
  abstract: >- 
    The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify multiple-choice questions that lack a correct answer is a crucial aspect of educational assessment quality and an indicator of their critical thinking skills. This paper investigates the performance of various LLMs on such questions, revealing that models experience, on average, a 55\% reduction in performance when faced with questions lacking a correct answer. The study also highlights that Llama 3.1-405B demonstrates a notable capacity to detect the absence of a valid answer, even when explicitly instructed to choose one. The findings emphasize the need for LLMs to prioritize critical thinking over blind adherence to instructions and caution against their use in educational settings where questions with incorrect answers might lead to inaccurate evaluations. This research establishes a benchmark for assessing critical thinking in LLMs and underscores the ongoing need for model alignment to ensure their responsible and effective use in educational and other critical domains.

  title: "Bayesian Ensemble Learning for Robust Time Series Forecasting in Financial Markets"
  author-title: "AI Investments"
  abstract: >- 
    In the volatile world of financial markets, accurate time series forecasting is essential for making informed decisions. While traditional ensemble methods have their strengths, they often fall short in capturing the uncertainty and variability that can significantly affect model performance over time. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian ensemble learning approach designed specifically for forecasting financial time series. By integrating past model errors into a probabilistic framework, our method dynamically adjusts the weights of individual models within the ensemble. This is achieved through Bayesian inference, which allows us to estimate the posterior distributions of model weights and biases, leading to a more robust aggregation of predictions that naturally accounts for uncertainty.  We test the proposed approach across a diverse set of financial instruments, showing that it consistently improves forecasting accuracy and stability when compared to conventional methods. Beyond improved performance, the Bayesian framework also provides deeper insights into the confidence of our predictions, offering a quantifiable measure of uncertainty that is particularly valuable for risk management and strategic planning in financial contexts. Our results indicate that this method not only enhances predictive accuracy but also provides crucial guidance in understanding the underlying dynamics of the market.  This research advances the field of financial forecasting by presenting a method that effectively balances precision and uncertainty, offering a powerful tool for both practitioners and researchers aiming to better navigate the complexities of financial markets.

  title: "Addressing the Devastating Effects of Single-Task Data Poisoning in Exemplar-free Continual Learning"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning – the intentional manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning models – was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP) threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm. Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison task detection method based on task vectors.

  title: "Probabilistically Plausible Counterfactual Explanations with Normalizing Flows"
  author-title: "DataWalk / Wrocław University of Science and Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    In this presentation, I will introduce the domain of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), focusing on counterfactual explanations, and introduce our method, PPCEF—a novel approach for generating probabilistically plausible counterfactual explanations. PPCEF stands out by integrating a probabilistic framework that aligns with the underlying data distribution while optimizing for plausibility. Unlike existing approaches, PPCEF directly optimizes the density function without assuming a specific parametric distribution, ensuring that counterfactuals are both valid and consistent with the data's probability density.  By leveraging normalizing flows as powerful density estimators, PPCEF effectively captures complex, high-dimensional data distributions. Our novel loss function balances the need for a class change with maintaining similarity to the original instance, incorporating probabilistic plausibility. The unconstrained formulation of PPCEF allows for efficient gradient-based optimization, significantly accelerating computations and enabling future customization with specific counterfactual constraints.

  abstract: >- 
    Does the stethoscope in the picture make the adjacent person a doctor or a patient? This, of course, depends on the contextual relationship of the two objects. If it’s obvious, why don’t explanation methods for vision models use contextual information?  The role of context has been widely covered in Natural Language Processing and Time Series but much less in Computer Vision. I will explain what contextual information within images is, using some real-world examples. I will outline how the issue of spatial context was addressed in the Deep Learning models and contrast it with the small number of works concerning the topic within the field of Explainable AI (XAI). I will show examples of failures of popular XAI methods when the spatial context plays a significant role. Finally, I will argue that there is a need to change the approach to explanations from 'where' to 'how'.

  abstract: >- 
    Decoupling lighting from geometry using unconstrained photo collections is notoriously challenging. Solving it would benefit many users as creating complex 3D assets takes days of manual labor. Many previous works have attempted to address this issue, often at the expense of output fidelity, which questions the practicality of such methods. We introduce LumiGauss - a technique that tackles 3D reconstruction of scenes and environmental lighting through 2D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach yields high-quality scene reconstructions and enables realistic lighting synthesis under novel environment maps. We also propose a method for enhancing the quality of shadows, common in outdoor scenes, by exploiting spherical harmonics properties. Our approach facilitates seamless integration with game engines and enables the use of fast precomputed radiance transfer. We validate our method on the NeRF-OSR dataset, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods. Moreover, LumiGauss can synthesize realistic images when applying novel environment maps.

    AI models can become obsolete after training as new data becomes available. Re-training large models is costly and energy inefficient. Continual Learning attempts to find a solution to one of the most challenging bottlenecks of current AI models - the fact that data distribution changes over time. In my poster I would like to show the capabilities of Continual Learning methods for multimodal models, and in particular for vision-language models such as CLIP. Vision-Language models can handle both textual and visual data, which has a wide range of use cases such as image analysis, object recognition and scene understanding, image captioning, answering visual questions, and more. I will present the current state of the art in applying Continual Learning to vision-language models, their limitations and opportunities for improvement, and the results of experiments on selected methods.

  title: "Assessing the Impact of Unlearning Methods on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models"
  author-title: "IDEAS NCBR, Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and Imagen set a new standard in generating photorealistic images. However, their widespread use raises concerns about the nature of the content they produce, particularly when models are trained on large datasets that may include inappropriate or copyrighted material. In response, various unlearning methods have been developed to effectively remove unwanted information. This research evaluates the impact of unlearning methods on the overall performance of text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we examine how unlearning certain content influences the models' ability to generate accurate and diverse images across different concepts. Through a series of experiments, we investigate potential trade-offs, such as unintended reductions in image quality or diminishing features related to the remaining classes. Our findings offer valuable insights into balancing the need to eliminate specific content with the goal of preserving the broader functionality and integrity of diffusion models.

  title: "Style and Object Low-Rank Continual Personalization of Diffusion Models"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation. Moreover, recent personalization methods such as Dreambooth combined with low-rank adaptation techniques allow fine-tuning pre-trained models to generate concepts or styles absent in the original training data. However, the application of personalization techniques across multiple consecutive tasks exhibits a tendency to forget previously learned knowledge. While recent studies attempt to mitigate this issue by combining trained adapters across tasks post-fine-tuning, we adopt a more rigorous regime and investigate the personalization of large diffusion models under a continual learning scenario. To that end, we compare four different methodologies: (1) naive LoRA adapter fine-tuning, (2) merging adapters with further fine-tuning through reinitialization, (3) leveraging orthogonalization during adapters reinitialization, and (4) updating only relevant (according to the current task) parameters of trained LoRA weights. Finally, the findings from our comprehensive experiments indicate improvements by decreasing forgetting over the baseline approach and provide a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, highlighting the nuances between style and object personalization in the context of continual fine-tuning.

  title: "Efficient Intent Detection Across Multiple Industries: A Unified Approach"
  author-title: "Zendesk"
  abstract: >- 
    In order to have efficient customer service support, it is important to have a model capable of detecting the intent of customer messages, allowing support agents to not only understand the content of the message promptly but also to react accordingly. In particular, user requests may come in from different domains (e.g. Software, E-commerce or Finance), therefore maintaining separate models for each industry or business can become impracticable as the client base grows.  In this work we study an alternative approach of scaling intent detection to numerous clients by employing a single generic model accompanied with a per-client list of relevant intents. These lists of intents can be derived from historical customer data or even directly obtained from the client’s feedback, granting a more customizable client experience. In addition to enabling clients to modify their list of relevant intents, our technique reduces costs by requiring less training and maintenance compared to managing several models associated with each domain. Furthermore, we describe a strategy where the client list of intents is inserted as model features to accommodate for the changes in the intent lists. This method demonstrates how robust it is to client-made adjustments to such intent lists, which frequently occur in real-world situations whenever a client’s domain changes. When compared to industry-specific models, we are able to achieve greater performance with the augmented generic model with per-client intent lists, indicating the adaptability and capacity of the model to meet a wider range of client requirements.

  title: "FACTM: a Bayesian model for integrating structured and tabular data"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    Integrating information across various data modalities can be beneficial for gaining valuable insights into underlying phenomena. Numerous methods exist for multi-modal data integration, ranging from linear matrix factorization-based approaches to nonlinear methods employing i.e. deep generative models. However, linear integration becomes particularly challenging when one or more modalities exhibit complex structures, such as image-based, or spatial, while others do not. In such cases, existing strategies often rely on preprocessing structured data as an initial step. We present FACTM, a novel method that leverages a Bayesian probabilistic graphical model to address this challenge. Our approach combines two models. Firstly, it uses a correlated topic model (CTM), a widely used technique in text mining, to uncover the structure present in specific modalities of the data. In particular, the CTM part identifies meaningful clusters and shares information about the observation-wise changes of fractions of specific clusters with the second component of the model. Secondly, it employs a multi-modal factor analysis (FA), a matrix factorization technique commonly used in fields where interpretation is critical. This FA component integrates information and identifies common latent factors shared across all modalities, including structured data. Importantly, our model extracts information from complex modalities and runs factor analysis simultaneously, allowing both components of the model to potentially enhance each other's performance. Optimal parameters are determined using Bayesian variational inference. When structured data consists of documents with text, the topics are defined in the standard way. In the context of spatial imaging of single cells, the CTM component of FACTM clusters spatial niches (analogous to sentences) which are groups of cells (analogous to words) into niche types (topics). These niche types are defined as the distribution of cell types within them. Meanwhile, the FA component integrates information from various structured and plain modalities to uncover common latent factors. In the poster, we will provide a detailed description of the model, along with results demonstrating its practical application. We will present findings derived from multi-omics data obtained from the IMMUcan consortium.

  title: "Interpretable Rule-Based Data-to-Text Generation Using Large Language Models"
  author-title: "Poznan University Of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    In the field of natural language generation (NLG), converting structured data into coherent text poses significant challenges. "Interpretable Rule-Based Data-to-Text Generation Using Large Language Models," introduces a novel approach that integrates the interpretability and precision of rule-based systems with the generative power of large language models (LLMs). This method focuses on generating Python code to transform RDF triples into readable text, achieving a balance between accuracy and flexibility.  Approach: The core innovation lies in automating the creation of a rule-based system using LLMs. The process involves three key steps:  Rule Generation: An LLM is prompted to write Python code that specifies how to convert given RDF triples into natural language text. Rule Testing: The generated code is checked for syntactic correctness and its output is compared to desired references to ensure alignment. Rule Refinement: The code undergoes iterative refinement using silver-standard references, reducing hallucinations and enhancing accuracy. This approach leverages the strengths of both rule-based and neural methods, creating a system that runs efficiently on a single CPU without the need for GPU resources.  Experimental Results: Evaluations on the WebNLG dataset demonstrate that this system outperforms zero-shot LLMs in BLEU and BLEURT scores, and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to a fine-tuned BART model. The system's interpretability allows for easy modification and extension by developers, providing high control over the output.  Highlights:  The system achieves higher text quality than zero-shot LLMs. It produces fewer hallucinations than a fine-tuned BART baseline. The rule-based approach offers full interpretability and control over generated text. It operates efficiently on a single CPU, eliminating the need for costly GPU resources.  This research presents a promising step towards creating efficient, interpretable, and flexible NLG systems by combining the strengths of rule-based and neural approaches. It opens new avenues for further advancements in the field, particularly in multilingual text generation.

  title: "Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning with Mixture-of-Experts models"
  author-title: "University of Cologne"
  abstract: >- 
    Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution to collaborative learning when sharing private data is not possible. However, domain shift among the different clients in the federation remains an important challenge. When this occurs, the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) strategy typically performs poorly, as each client optimizes towards its local empirical risk minimum, which may be inconsistent with the global direction. Handling this issue is not only of theoretical interest, but could be critical in real-world scenarios, for example, in medical applications where each client acquires geographically-biased data using its own protocol.  The problem of non-independent, identically distributed (non-iid) data in FL has been studied mainly on situations where it is the distribution of labels that shifts among clients, and there is limited work on data originated from different domains. In the FL literature, non-iid distributions are commonly addressed with novel federated algorithms that train a better global model, or that include local models that mitigate the biases of their respective clients.  In this work, we study how the domain shift problem can be overcome by using Mixture-of-Experts architectures (MoEs). The MoE layers that we employ compute their output as a linear combination of the outputs of a pool of experts, where the coefficients are predicted by a router network. Furthermore, if the routing to the experts is sparse, the computation of unused experts can be spared, providing a boost in inference speed. Our experiments show that the ability of MoEs to process different inputs with different experts can be exploited to automatically deal with data heterogeneity among clients, and a single global model can be trained even with a naive FedAvg strategy without compromising performance. Additionally, we report an increase in accuracy when the gradients of the MoE layers are estimated using a heuristic. Overall, we show that MoEs make a solid solution to federated scenarios where data heterogeneity is a concern.

  title: "Application of machine learning to support pen & paper RPG game design"
  author-title: "AGH University of Krakow"
  abstract: >- 
    Many real-life scenarios require the prediction of ordinal variables, a task well-suited for ordinal regression methods. These methods include classical regression models with rounding as well as specialized approaches designed specifically for ordinal data. In this talk, we will introduce the topic of ordinal regression and its algorithms and evaluation methods. One of many possible applications of these methods is determining challenge levels of monsters in pen & paper RPG games. Currently there is no automatic way to estimate these levels. However, it is a natural task for machine learning, as opponents are described by long vectors of numerical features and levels are ordinal values. Usage of ordinal regression can help reduce costs for publishers during the design process. We will describe the experiments, evaluation framework, and results.

  title: "Repurposing Pharmaceuticals for Organophosphorus Poisoning"
  author-title: "Military University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Organophosphorus (OP) compounds found in pesticides and chemical warfare agents (CWA), continue to pose a significant global health risk. There are still over 385 million cases of unintended acute pesticide poisoning annually, mostly in southern Asia and east Africa, resulting in approximately 11,000 deaths, despite a global push to reduce the use of pesticides. There is also a significant number of intended OP poisoning, mostly in suicide attempts. The number of OP poisoning could escalate rapidly in the event of terrorist incidents, warfare and other crises. Due to geographic focus of the problem and the relatively small number of cases, there is little interest in developing new drugs against OP poisoning. Notably the most used antidote, pralidoxime (2-PAM), was developed in 1950s. Most studied antidotes are charged molecules and therefore poorly penetrate the blood-brain-barrier.   Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals offers a strategic solution to the lack of interest in developing novel antidotes, as the drug discovery is both costly and time-consuming. This study employs a structure-based method for repurposing compouds from the ChEMBL database. a machine learning model constructed with Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm is applied to classify compounds as actives or inactives in treating organophosphorus poisoning. The training database was created by curating PubChem compounds tested against acetylcholinesterase (gene ID 43), focusing on bioassays containing the terms „reactivation” and „nimp”, „gb”, „sarin”, „sp-gbc” or „sp-gb-am”. The model was trained using the structural representations of 62 molecules. The approach was evaluated using the Leave-One-Out cross validation method, yielding an area under the ROC curve of 0.93. Since 52 of the training molecules contained an oxime moiety, the classification was limited to such compounds. Among 34 oximes from ChEMBL database 16 were classified as actives and chosen for further analysis including protein - ligand docking.

  title: "Efficiently enhancing product design process with Stable Diffusion"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology; IDEAS NCBR"
  abstract: >- 
    Navigating the landscape of product design demands a nuanced approach, necessitating considerable time and expertise. The integration of AI-aided design systems, though promising, demands substantial resource allocation. In response to these imperatives, this work introduces an innovative solution poised to enhance and expedite the product design process. Leveraging the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion Model, a cutting-edge framework for generative image generation, our approach propounds a streamlined and resource-efficient methodology to efficiently empower the product design process. Our solution demonstrates three key capabilities: 1) facilitating the generation of new product designs and styles observed on e-commerce platforms; 2) swiftly creating product prototypes based on existing products or new designer sketches; 3) enabling precise modifications to product designs according to the designer's preferences. Leveraging the dreambooth technique, we seamlessly incorporate new styles or products with minimal input data, diversifying design possibilities dynamically. Precision is attained through the ControlNET mechanism, informed by a visual prior, aligning output with a desired product shape. Finally, a masking mechanism allows for product editing to enhance customization. Noteworthy, our solution requires only a single 8GB RAM GPU. Successfully developed, tested, and applied at Eljot Sp. z o. o., specialists in wooden product design, our solution showcases the potential to revolutionize and accelerate the product design process.

  title: "GUIDE: Guidance-based Incremental Learning with Diffusion Models"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    We introduce GUIDE, a novel continual learning approach that directs diffusion models to rehearse samples at risk of being forgotten. Existing generative strategies combat catastrophic forgetting by randomly sampling rehearsal examples from a generative model. Such an approach contradicts buffer-based approaches where sampling strategy plays an important role. We propose to bridge this gap by incorporating classifier guidance into the diffusion process to produce rehearsal examples specifically targeting information forgotten by a continuously trained model. This approach enables the generation of samples from preceding task distributions, which are more likely to be misclassified in the context of recently encountered classes. Our experimental results show that GUIDE significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting, outperforming conventional random sampling approaches and surpassing recent state-of-the-art methods in continual learning with generative replay.

  title: "Boosting Neurodegenerative Disorder Screenings with Machine Learning"
  author-title: "University of Cologne"
  abstract: >- 
    REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a critical biomarker for the early stages of alpha-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's Disease, Lewy-Body-Dementia, or Multi-System-Atrophy. Early detection is crucial for advancing fundamental research and improving patient well-being. The current gold standard for diagnosis, polysomnography, is cost and labor-intensive and requires specialized sleep experts. To optimize the screening process, this research explores the use of wrist-worn accelerometers to make a pre-selection of high vs low-risk patients and thereby making RBD patients in a prodromal state visible to the medical sector.  In this poster, I present my research on developing a tree-based machine-learning classifier that discriminates between RBD patients and healthy controls. The model, trained on a cohort of 116 patients, demonstrates high performance, achieving 0.92±0.06 AUROC in nested cross-validation and 0.86 on an independent test set. This research highlights that in certain medical contexts, traditional machine learning models can be highly effective, often providing robust, interpretable results that meet the demands of real-world applications.

  author-title: "Poznan University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision have expanded the possibilities for detecting and tracking marine animals, including through drone surveillance. However, existing tools remain inadequate for precise detection, particularly in complex seabed environments. This project addresses this gap by developing a robust solution for detecting porpoises in video sequences captured by aerial robots. The proposed method integrates classical and deep learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and improve trajectory tracking. Furthermore, it enables detailed analyses, such as identifying keypoints like the tongue and tail, which facilitate animal measurement and movement monitoring. This tool is especially valuable for biological researchers studying porpoise behaviour in coastal waters, as it significantly reduces the need for manual labelling. The effectiveness of the solution is validated using real-world drone footage from shallow water environments.

  abstract: >- 
    Light pollution is a significant ecological and social problem that negatively affects human health, disrupts the natural circadian rhythms of organisms, and disrupts the functioning of ecosystems, leading to serious environmental consequences. According to current knowledge, one of the most important factors contributing to the increase in light pollution is not the intensity of light, but the large number of light sources in a given area. In this study, an object-detection model was used to detect street lights in aerial photos taken at night by a drone. In particular, the focus was on using the R-CNN algorithm for fast and efficient detection of street lights. The image processing model was trained based on collected and hand-annotated data from eight selected areas of Warsaw. The model showed high precision in locating the street lights, which is of great importance for urban planners in developing strategies to reduce light pollution and optimize the layout of urban lighting.

  title: "Comparing Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Multi-Metric Evaluation"
  author-title: "Tooploox"
  abstract: >- 
    The rapid evolution of generative AI has led to widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various industries. However, a comprehensive comparison highlighting their strengths and weaknesses is often lacking. This study aims to fill that gap by evaluating popular open-source and commercial LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Mistral, and Llama13B, in conjunction with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our methodology involved a standardized dataset, a set of relevant questions, and a suite of metrics like answer correctness, faithfulness, and context relevance. The results revealed significant performance variations across models, with GPT-4 generally providing the most accurate answers. Interestingly, open-source models like Mistral demonstrated competitive performance, particularly in faithfulness. Furthermore, while GPT-4 was the only model to admit to lack of necessary information, others tended to generate hallucinated responses when unable to provide accurate answers. This study underscores the importance of choosing the right LLM for specific use cases and the potential of open-source models as viable alternatives to their commercial counterparts.

  abstract: >- 
    Although large language models like GPT, Gemini and Claude have demonstrated promising capabilities in processing the Polish language and representing basic medical knowledge, their application in production medical environments faces significant limitations, including issues with data privacy, lack of transparency and control over the model, and instability over time. To address these challenges and increase the potential of AI utilisation in Polish medicine, we have developed Eskulap - an open-source medical model designed for safe integration with hospital infrastructure. This model addresses the previous lack of dedicated medical models in Polish, similar to those available in English. To build Eskulap we have gathered medical information from a diverse array of sources: medical websites, Polish Wikipedia, healthcare flyers, scientific publications, and anonymised clinical notes. The cornerstone of our data strategy was the creation of 800,000 synthetic medical instructions, transforming unstructured data into a rich learning foundation. We have then used Bileik-v2 as the base model and fine-tuned it using LoRa techniques to make it aligned with medical instructions This new model aims to open unprecedented possibilities for AI applications in Polish healthcare while addressing key challenges related to privacy, control, and stability. It has the potential to transform various aspects of medical practice, from assisting in documentation to supporting clinical decision-making.

  title: "Evaluation of AI-Based Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring in Non-Contrastive Cardiac CT"
  author-title: "Hemolens Diagnostics"
  abstract: >- 
    In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based tools have grown in popularity in medical imaging processing. They offer a rapid and non-invasive way of monitoring diseases and assessing their progression.  In the coronary artery disease (CAD) monitoring, a key diagnostic feature is a so-called calcium scoring which is extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans. This feature measures an amount of calcifications that are collected inside the patient's vessels, obstructing a healthy blood flow and subsequently causing a cardiac ischemia.  This work focuses on the problem of evaluating coronary artery calcium scoring methods with non-contrastive cardiac CT. Practical issues related to convolutional neural networks such as local relationships between heart muscle and small anatomical objects such as plaques are discussed. Additionally, we validate different models used to detect abnormalities in medical images using artificial intelligence.

  title: "Improving Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Modeling Molecular Transport in the Human Brain"
  author-title: "Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    This study focuses on enhancing the quality and efficiency of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling molecular transport in the human brain, particularly for estimating diffusion coefficients from MRI data. While PINNs are effective in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), they struggle with noisy data. The goal is to refine the PINN approach to improve its reliability and consistency, making it a viable alternative to traditional methods like the finite element method (FEM) for solving inverse problems in medical imaging. Building on the work of Zapf et al. (2022), various enhancements to the standard physics-informed neural network formulation are explored to improve performance with noisy data. This involves experimenting with different neural network architectures and incorporating operator learning to better capture complex dynamics. Techniques such as tuning the loss function and using adaptive refinement of training points are applied to enhance data fidelity and parameter estimation. Both synthetic and real life test cases, as well as comparisons with classical methods, are used to evaluate the impact of these improvements on the accuracy and efficiency of estimating diffusion coefficients from MRI data. Preliminary results indicate that the improved PINN approach, enhances quality and efficiency in estimating the diffusion coefficient from MRI data. Comparisons between different neural network architectures and classical methods, like the finite element method, show promise, but further tests are required to confirm these findings. While early findings suggest that the improved PINN method offers advantages in accuracy and efficiency over traditional approaches, decisive conclusions cannot yet be drawn. More extensive testing and validation are necessary to establish the robustness and general applicability of the proposed improvements in clinical settings.

  title: "Cayley-Maze: Reinforcement Learning environment with variable complexity"
  author-title: "IDEAS NCBR"
  abstract: >- 
    One of the key challenges in contemporary Reinforcement Learning (RL) is effectively addressing problems of algorithmic nature. A deeper understanding of the computational expressive power of architectures could greatly aid in solving such problems and in designing more effective architectures. To address this, we introduce the Cayley-Maze, an open-ended RL environment with variable computational complexity. The Cayley-Maze environment offers several notable features:  - Any finite RL environment can be represented as a specific instance of the Cayley-Maze. - The Cayley-Maze naturally extends and generalizes classical problems such as sorting, solving the Rubik's Cube, and integer factorization.  Additionally, this environment is particularly valuable for Unsupervised Environment Design and Curriculum Learning, where the core strategy involves gradually increasing the complexity of proposed problems.

  title: "Multimodal and Contextualised Machine Translation in the E-commerce Domain"
  author-title: "Allegro / TU Wien"
  abstract: >- 
    The most popular paradigm in modern Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is sentence-level translation. However, this approach often lacks broader context, leading to challenges with homonyms, transliterations, pronouns, and stylistic nuances. Moreover, texts in the e-commerce domain possess a specific grammatical structure, often lacking clear sentence boundaries. To address these limitations, this research investigates whether incorporating additional context from metadata and images can enhance translation quality, particularly for offer titles and product names in the e-commerce domain.  Leveraging recent advancements in vision and language modeling, including large language models (LLMs) such as LLaVA and PaliGemma, we developed and evaluated multimodal translation models tailored for the e-commerce domain. Our methodology involved creating a new multimodal dataset for Polish-to-Czech translation, comprising over 200,000 parallel sentences paired with product images. We used LoRA and backtranslation techniques for fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, we evaluated our experiments using several test sets designed to highlight translation ambiguities.  Our primary research questions focused on the impact of contextual information and the role of image data in improving translation quality. Results indicate that image context improves model performance on both lexical and neural evaluation metrics, particularly for more ambiguous sentences. We also demonstrate that open-source LLMs can struggle with zero- and few-shot machine translation for less common language pairs. Notably, we observed that LLMs trained solely on text data still benefited from visual cues during inference, resulting in an increase of more than 1% in BLEU and COMET scores. Furthermore, we explored the impact of adversarial examples, such as the use of incorrect images during inference, and found that such inputs can degrade LLM performance. In conclusion, we believe that context-based information can improve the fluency and adequacy of NMT for short texts.

  title: "Bayesian Network for Prediction of Vital Functions by Autonomous Triage"
  author-title: "KN BIT"
  abstract: >- 
    Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs) pose significant challenges for emergency medical systems, requiring rapid and efficient assessment of numerous casualties amidst limited resources and potential hazards. This paper introduces a novel approach for monitoring and evaluating patients in MCI scenarios through the use of a Bayesian Network that integrates data from various machine learning algorithms. The proposed solution combines outputs from independent algorithms that monitor vital signs such as heart rate, respiration rate, and severe hemorrhage. Unlike traditional methods, our Bayesian network was developed solely based on expert knowledge, without reliance on training datasets. This Bayesian approach offers several key benefits: it support inference with incomplete patient data, enhances the reliability and consistency of vital sign detection, and demonstrates robustness against errors and biases from external factors. Additionally, it facilitates faster decision-making in critical situations. Our method has the potential to significantly improve the triage process in MCI scenarios, helping responders and medical personnel to prioritize care more effectively. By bridging the gap between machine learning algorithms and medical expertise, our solution aims to improve patient assessment tools in mass casualty response efforts , ultimately contributing to a higher number of lives saved in emergencies.

  title: "Generating Semantic Context for Data Interoperability in Relational Databases using BGE M3-Embeddings"
  author-title: "Vienna University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Relational databases store a significant portion of the world’s most valuable data by managing data in tables. It is a common misconception that by providing expressive table- and column names, researchers have sufficient context to reuse the data adequately. Without proper (machine-)understandable context, researchers face a data interoperability problem, i.e. the challenge to confidently interpret data due to lack of context. This problem becomes evident when sharing data in data repositories such as DBRepo [1] that make it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable to anyone globally.  To aid researchers in the difficult task of mapping a relational database schema to ontologies that describe the conceptual and quantitative context, we use a structure-level matching method based on machine learning. Our semi-automatic mapping system utilizes the BGE M3-Embedding model [2] to encode column names and ontology entity labels. It employs a cosine similarity to identify the best-matching ontology concept for each table column.  This approach successfully matches 89.9% of the contextual correct semantic concepts and units of measurements within the first 10% of all entities (entity coverage) and achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.5259, outperforming all other approaches. A similar approach is employed to calculate the similarity between columns and units of measurement entities, with an encoding method that adds the "unit" keyword at the end of entity labels. This achieves a 64.4% entity coverage and 0.1164 MRR, also surpassing all other tested approaches.  Let ci={c1, …, ci} with 1 ≤ i ≤ n be a column of a relational database table schema. Each ci may optionally have exactly one concept entity (semantic concept) eci and exactly one unit of measurement entity eui assigned. Based on the column names C={c1, …, cn}, our approach suggests top-level ontologies as well as semantic concepts and unit of measurement for each column. Users can correct the suggested semantic concepts by selecting different concept entity mappings. This selection influences the identification of the respective column’s unit of measurement.  We evaluated the efficacy of our method through observing expert users that were trained briefly on the user interface. On average, a researcher needs to click 1.36 times on average to correctly map a column ck to a concept entity eck. Our method is 9.8 times faster than mapping the entity names manually (i.e. typing them). For correctly mapping a unit of measurement entity euk to a column ck, our approach requires the researcher to click 5.745 times on average. This makes our method 2.48 times faster than manually typing the entity names. Note that the minimum number of clicks is calculated by simulating user interactions such as clicking on a drop-down from our user interface is counted as one click.

  title: "Spacelet - uncovering patterns of infiltration in the multiplex immunofluorescence data"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    Introduction Spatial proteomics, such as multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) is a medical imaging technique that generates multi-channel data at a single-cell resolution from a tumour sample. When sampled for cohorts of cancer patients, spatial proteomics  data can provide useful prognostic information and insights into the organisation of tumour immune microenvironment (TME). Current approaches towards spatial proteomics data analysis focus only on small cellular neighbourhoods, ignoring the broader spatial context.  Method Here, we introduce Spacelet - a novel algorithmic and statistical approach designed to discover patterns of infiltration within spatial tumour data. Given the nature of cancer spatial proteomics data, we incorporate a graph-based approach toward modelling and represent the data as a collection of disjoint spatial tumour cell islets (hence Spacelet). Later, we decompose these islets into a sequence of layers that start from the tumour border and go deeply into the tumour interior. These structures are useful in capturing the variety of infiltration patterns, which we obtain by clustering cellular abundances at consequent layers using Wasserstein distance.  Results We validated the performance of Spacelet on 576 samples from NSCLC2 192 patients, collected by the IMMUcan consortium (immucan.org) and 68 samples from 34 melanoma patients from the National Institute of Oncology (NIO), Poland. In both datasets, Spacelet identified the same patterns of infiltration (uniform and interior-excluded), which correlate strongly with clinical variables. Among others, in the NSCLC2 cohort, Spacelet discovered that interior-excluded and uniform infiltration patterns differentiate histology subtypes, while in the Melanoma cohort, Spacelet linked interior-excluded infiltration with survival, progression, and response to treatment.  Conclusions Results from the application of Spacelet to different datasets prove the efficacy of our approach in inferring biologically meaningful spatial characteristics of infiltration patterns in tumour tissues. With further applications of our method, we aim to deepen the understanding of the spatial organisation of TME and provide insights for potential directions of improvements for immunotherapy treatment strategies.

  title: "Iris-ML: Simulation-Based Inference for the Spectral Energy Distribution fitting."
  author-title: "Astronomical Observatory, University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    Markov chain sampling is a versatile algorithm used in modern astronomy for inference tasks. Unfortunately, it is not always suitable for large inference tasks where the evaluation of the likelihood function is computationally expensive. Here, an alternative approach is presented, in the form of a Simulation-Based Inference. I use it to tackle the Spectral Energy Distribution fitting problem. The basic idea for this type of analysis is to uncover the true physical properties of objects by fitting complicated physical models to broadband brightness measurements. Mastering analysis of the photometric data is essential for modern astronomical research. Based on the transformer architecture for the preprocessing, the proposed model greatly accelerates the sampling process with the help of the MAF Normalizing Flow. Such models are a great step forward compared to the usually used MCMC, as they allow for a much faster sampling procedure. They will become more influential, as the next generation of astronomical surveys will produce unprecedented amounts of data, that need to be processed.

  title: "Siamese Ensembles for image data augmentation"
  author-title: "AGH University of Krakow"
  abstract: >- 
    Even the most powerful neural network architectures can be useless when provided with a small amount of training data. In this scenario, the use of data augmentation techniques can help with generalization. However, they should be applied carefully, as some modifications can alter the labels of the samples, which may be difficult to spot without expert knowledge. In this work, we introduce a simple label-preserving image data augmentation technique, especially suitable for small datasets. This network training method allows for expanding the data by using pairs of images instead of single samples in an ensemble learning-like manner and is inspired by Siamese neural networks, with two networks working together to achieve a common goal. It can be easily implemented to improve the accuracy of various image classification tasks and be particularly useful for smaller, medical or technology industry-related datasets. In our experiments, we focus on a difficult and very specific aircraft dataset, containing images of fuselage of aircraft structures, with corroded and non-corroded surfaces. We also provide results on standard baseline data. Our preliminary experiments showed that the proposed augmentation improves the classification accuracy by even over a dozen percentage points, and the gain in accuracy is especially visible in the case of a smaller dataset size.

  title: "Beyond ChatGPT: A Reproducibility and Generalizability Study of Large Language Models for Query Generation"
  author-title: "TU Wien"
  abstract: >- 
    Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a cornerstone of academic research, yet they are often labour-intensive and time-consuming due to the detailed literature curation process.  The advent of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) promises to revolutionize this process by assisting researchers in several tedious tasks, one of them being the generation of effective Boolean queries that will select the publications to consider including in a review. This paper presents a extensive study of Boolean query generation using LLMs for systematic reviews, reproducing and extending the work of Wang et al. and Alaniz et al.  Our study investigates the replicability and reliability of results achieved using ChatGPT and compares its performance with open-source alternatives like Mistral and Zephyr to provide a comprehensive analysis of LLMs for query generation.   Therefore, we implemented a pipeline, which automatically creates a Boolean query for a given review topic by using a previously selected LLM, retrieves all documents for this query from the PubMed database and then evaluates the results.   With this pipeline we first assess whether the results obtained using ChatGPT for query generation are reproducible and consistent. We then generalize our results by analyzing and evaluating open-source models and evaluating their efficacy in generating Boolean queries.

  title: "ImplicitDeepfake: Plausible Face-Swapping through Implicit Deepfake Avatar Generation using NeRF and Gaussian Splatting"
  author-title: "Jagiellonian University"
  abstract: >- 
    Numerous emerging deep-learning techniques have had a substantial impact on computer graphics. Among the most promising breakthroughs is the rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and, more recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS). These methods have demonstrated their potential across multiple domains, showcasing the ability to reconstruct a 3D representation of a scene from 2D images.  In this work, we build on these existing technologies to propose a novel workflow for generating 3D deepfake representations. Our contribution introduces ImplicitDeepfake, an effective method that from a single 2D image of a person (named in further references a celebrity) and an auxiliary dataset of external images we can obtain a high-quality 3D representation of the subject. Our pipeline is as follows: from a 2D image of a celebrity and a set of 2D pictures of an anonymous 3D model, along with associated camera positions ( NeRF Synthetic dataset), we achieve a plausible 3D deepfake of the celebrity, utilizing any of the aforementioned 3D representation solutions.  Interestingly, the direct enhancement of the pipeline we propose adapts well in 4D use cases, where time is the fourth dimension. We show this using the existing NeRFace model, which handles dynamic facial expressions in video sequences. The results we receive are of decent quality, despite the simplicity of the introduced modification.  Additionally, we propose the extension of our approach that incorporates diffusion models, allowing for text-based modifications and customization of the generated avatars. By conditioning the input images with text prompts before 3D reconstruction, ImplicitDeepfake enables straightforward personalization of the avatars, enhancing their realism and adaptability.  Overall, our work demonstrates a novel integration of 2D deepfake technology with cutting-edge 3D image generation techniques, resulting in a powerful tool for creating and customizing 3D digital identities from minimal input data.

  title: "Robust Self-Supervised Learning Across Diverse Downstream Tasks"

  abstract: >- 
    Large-scale vision models have become integral in many applications due to their unprecedented performance and versatility across downstream tasks. However, the robustness of these founda- tion models has primarily been explored for a sin- gle task, image classification. The vulnerability of other common vision tasks, such as seman- tic segmentation and depth estimation, remains largely unknown. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the adversarial robustness of self-supervised vision encoders across multi- ple downstream tasks. Our attacks operate in the encoder embedding space and at the downstream task output level. In both cases, current state-of- the-art adversarial fine-tuning techniques tested only for classification significantly degrade clean and robust performance on other tasks. Since the purpose of a foundation model is to cater to mul- tiple applications at once, our findings reveal the need to enhance encoder robustness more broadly. We propose potential strategies for more robust foundation vision models across diverse down- stream tasks.

  abstract: >- 
    Various available benchmarks for LLM evaluation focus on a broad area of LLM capabilities like mathematical reasoning, academic knowledge and factual questing answering. However, there are significantly less benchmarks and datasets that focus on linguistic capabilities of LLMs and their knowledge of topics related to English language and grammar. As a research team focused mainly on applications of LLMs in English learning we decided to create our custom framework for evaluation of linguistic knowledge and language capabilities of LLMs. We prepared more than 20 different tasks, each measuring some specific linguistic skill of the LLMs to enable comparison of state-of-the-art models for our applications. We also implemented an evaluation pipeline based on the designed tasks using Azure AI Studio and created a dashboard presenting performance of different LLMs on our custom language tasks.

  title: "Big Data for Structural Biology at the Swiss Light Source Synchrotron Facility"
  author-title: "Paul Scherrer Institute"
  abstract: >- 
    Macromolecular crystallography (MX) is a primary experimental technique for exploring the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules, such as proteins and ribonucleic acid molecules. Recent advances in MX allow visualization of such molecules at atomic resolution during reactions, with time resolution from femtoseconds to seconds. MX is also heavily used by pharmaceutical companies for structure-based drug design.  MX is best performed at accelerator facilities, like synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers, which benefit from stable and bright X-ray beams. Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) operates two large research facilities: the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron and SwissFEL. SLS is undergoing a major, two-year-long upgrade to become a fourth-generation synchrotron with up to two orders of magnitude higher X-ray brightness. All aspects of the instrumentation must be considered to benefit from the accelerator upgrade.  One critical challenge for the new facility will be a significant increase in data volumes. While in 2007 cutting-edge instruments produced data on the order of a few hundredth megabytes per second, today a single 9 Mpixel JUNGFRAU detector can collect X-ray diffraction images at rates of 2000 images per second, producing 36 GB/s of raw data. Simply saving such a data stream is challenging, especially when multiple such detectors are used. The only feasible solution is to analyze and reduce data on the fly.  I will highlight the challenges of operating such demanding scientific instruments. I will then present solutions developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute for sustainable handling of exponential increases in experimental data rates. Specifically, I will show my development, Jungfraujoch. Jungfraujoch is a single high-end server capable of handling and reducing a 36 GB/s stream of detector data using a combination of hardware accelerators (GPUs and FPGAs). I will present deterministic algorithms I’ve implemented and ported to the accelerator cards to perform feature extraction. I will also show ongoing efforts to implement deep learning algorithms at GB/s data rates. I will finally discuss the importance of Open Research Data initiatives at the Paul Scherrer Institute and the broad MX community.  At the end of the presentation, I will share first-hand experience working on two projects. The first project involved using GPUs and PyTorch to find an optimal crystal lattice for a given diffraction image, improving performance over prior CPU implementation by two orders of magnitude. It was done in collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Centre, a specialized institution within the ETH Domain that supports Swiss scientists with machine learning competence. The second project I’m currently realizing is funded by the Swiss Agency of Innovation, and it involves commercializing my Jungfraujoch development by the leading X-ray detector company, DECTRIS.

  title: "On the Robustness of Global Feature Effect Explanations"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    We study the robustness of global post-hoc explanations for predictive models trained on tabular data. Effects of predictor features in black-box supervised learning are an essential diagnostic tool for model debugging and scientific discovery in applied sciences. However, how vulnerable they are to data and model perturbations remains an open research question. We introduce several theoretical bounds for evaluating the robustness of partial dependence plots and accumulated local effects. Our experimental results with synthetic and real-world datasets quantify the gap between the best and worst-case scenarios of (mis)interpreting machine learning predictions globally.

  title: "PROFIS: Design of structurally-novel drug candidates by probing molecular fingerprint space with RNNs"
  author-title: "Jagiellonian University, Faculty of Chemistry"
  abstract: >- 
    The contemporary landscape of drug discovery is characterized by the increasing complexity of the tasks, the rising cost of research and development, and the demand for faster and more efficient ways to bring innovative therapeutics to market. As a solution to these challenges, computational methods have become more prevalent, with generative ML paving the way to faster and more effective drug discovery in the recent years.  Before any computational algorithm can process a molecular structure, it needs to be encoded in a way that allows the machine to parse it. Several textual encoding methods have emerged, including SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System), its more recent and ML-suited counterpart DeepSMILES, and SELFIES (Self-referencing Embedded Strings). Another common way to represent molecular structures is to use molecular fingerprints (FPs). Those are structural representations of chemical compounds in the form of binary or numerical vectors that capture critical information about a molecule's constituent atoms, bonds, and substructures. In contrast to molecular graphs or textual encodings, FPs have the potential to extract information about biochemically relevant functional groups and present it in a compact, machine-readable format, and  have a great potential to be used as features for ML-based QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) modeling. In this study, we propose a novel generative model, PROFIS, which allows for the design of target-focused compound libraries by probing continuous fingerprint space with RNNs. PROFIS is an innovative molecular VAE that maps molecular fingerprints into a continuous, low-dimensional space and decodes molecule structures in a sequential notation, ensuring alignment with the initial FP description. In the task of generating potential novel ligands, PROFIS employs a Bayesian search algorithm in tandem with a QSAR model to traverse the space of embedded molecular FPs and identify subspaces that correspond to potential good binders. The latent vectors sampled from those subspaces are then decoded into textual formats, such as SMILES or DeepSMILES using a recurrent neural network. Since many FPs do not determine the full chemical structure, our method can generate diverse molecules that match the particular FP description. The generated structures are target-specific, which allows for generating potential ligands tailored to a specific receptor. We prove that PROFIS exhibits excellent scaffold-hopping capabilities, enabling the exploration of novel chemical space, an essential feature of computational tools for de novo ligand generation.   We present the application of our protocol in the task of ligand generation for the dopamine D2R. However, the developed methodology is universal and can be applied to any biological target provided a dataset of known ligands is available. To facilitate the widespread use of PROFIS, we share all the scripts needed to run the developed protocol via GitHub.

  title: "Application of vision transformers to protein-ligand affinity prediction."
  author-title: "Institute of biochemiostry and biophysics Polish Academy of Sciences"
  abstract: >- 
    The transformer architecture has revolutionized many areas related to AI. It was originally adopted for natural language processing (NLP), but in recent years there has been rapid development of transformer architectures for computer vision (CV) data, the so-called Vision Transformers (ViT). ViT is achieving spectacular results in many CV areas, displacing architectures based on convolutional neural networks. (CNN). In this paper, we present a successful application of ViT to the problem of protein-ligand affinity prediction based on 3D crystallographic complexes. Despite the relatively small dataset and the very complex nature of the problem, ViT achieves results comparable to the best methods used for this problem. The paper also includes extensive model diagnostics that provide information on important aspects of the input data and its representation.

  title: "Joint Diffusion models in Continual Learning"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    In this work, we introduce JDCL - a new method for continual learning with generative rehearsal based on joint diffusion models. Neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting defined as abrupt loss in the model's performance when retrained with additional data coming from a different distribution. Generative-replay-based continual learning methods try to mitigate this issue by retraining a model with a combination of new and rehearsal data sampled from a generative model. In this work, we propose to extend this idea by combining a continually trained classifier with a diffusion-based generative model into a single -- jointly optimized neural network. We show that such shared parametrization, combined with the knowledge distillation technique allows for stable adaptation to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, where it outperforms recent state-of-the-art generative replay techniques. Additionally, we extend our method to the semi-supervised continual learning setup, where it outperforms competing buffer-based replay techniques, and evaluate, in a self-supervised manner, the quality of trained representations.

  title: "Generative neural networks for fast and accurate Zero Degree Calorimeter simulation"
  author-title: "AGH University of Krakow"
  abstract: >- 
    The integration of generative neural networks into high-energy physics simulations is rapidly transforming the field, offering unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. A prominent application is the simulation of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) in the ALICE experiment at CERN. Traditionally, these simulations have relied on Monte Carlo methods, which, while highly accurate, are computationally intensive and time-consuming. By employing generative networks as surrogate models, we achieve a significant reduction in computational burden while maintaining high accuracy. In this work, we utilize the latest advancements in generative neural networks, specifically focusing on diffusion models and models based on vector quantization, to simulate the ZDC neutron detector. These state-of-the-art architectures enable the generation of high-fidelity data that closely mirrors real experimental results. We explore and compare the performance of the generative frameworks against established simulation methods. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of generative neural networks in providing fast yet accurate simulations, making them a valuable tool in the high-energy physics community.

  title: "FreSh: Frequency Shifting for Accelerated Neural Representation Learning"
  author-title: "Jagiellonian University"
  abstract: >- 
    Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently gained attention as a powerful approach for continuously representing signals such as images, videos, and 3D shapes using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). However, MLPs are known to exhibit a low-frequency bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details accurately. This limitation is typically addressed by incorporating high-frequency input embeddings or specialized activation layers. In this work, we demonstrate that these embeddings and activations are often configured with hyperparameters that perform well on average but are suboptimal for specific input signals under consideration, necessitating a costly grid search to identify optimal settings. Our key observation is that the initial frequency spectrum of an untrained model's output correlates strongly with the model's eventual performance on a given target signal. Leveraging this insight, we propose frequency shifting (or FreSh), a method that selects embedding hyperparameters to align the frequency spectrum of the model’s initial output with that of the target signal. We show that this simple initialization technique improves performance across various neural representation methods and tasks, achieving results comparable to extensive hyperparameter sweeps but with only marginal computational overhead compared to training a single model with default hyperparameters.

  title: "Exploring the potential of prompting strategies in TOD creation: humans vs machines in the challenges of dialog generating, annotating and defining text style"
  author-title: "SentiOne"
  abstract: >- 
    LLMs show great potential for being applied in the task of TOD dialog corpora generation, but not many works have explored this potential so far. The so far applied SOTA prompting strategies seem quite laborious and complicated (one prompt per dialog act or turn). Available works frequently describe the dialog generation process as successful, but the annotation one - as failed. On the other hand, good quality available human-created language resources (templates, scenarios, slots, intents, annotation methods, instructions) rarely get used together with the generative methods to obtain new, good quality datasets. Therefore, we have formulated a challenging research task: If an LLM was given the same instructions, scenarios and information as language experts would the quality of the outcome be sufficient for training of NLU and DST models for a real-life helpline?   In our work we used one shot prompting of the GPT 4o to generate a dataset of 300 task-oriented dialogues in the banking domain in the English language.  The generation process involved a different language style for the agent (polite, quite formal) and customer (colloquial) with a list of frequently occurring UGC phenomena (correction, typos, hesitation, etc.) and a list for spoken and written subsets of dialogs.  We have manually evaluated the quality of the dialogs and the correctness of the UGC phenomena listed by the model. Finally, we created another few-shot, in-context prompt for dialog annotation using our own DST tagset involving difficult phenomena, such as implied intents, inspired by the log observation of a real-life banking helpline.  We arrive at several conclusions. The quality of generated dialogs is comparable with the dialogs created by language experts. The result of the manual quality check was that 97% of dialogs were suitable for training and even some DST and UGC phenomena are addressed with a greater variety. There are quite many hallucinations, though. Among over 20 classes of UGC phenomena we can rate only 5 as “understood” (correctness above 80%, high representation, e.g. colloquial language, small letters), 5 as “not understood” or hallucinated (correctness below 1%, single representation in the corpus): e.g. corrections, mispronunciation, and some as avoided phenomena: vulgarisms (98% of omissions), onomatopoeia, emoticons (75%), popular abbreviations, request of a pause (around 50%).   We found the annotation quality of NLU tags good enough for tasks such as Intent Detection (about 90% of correct tags). However, other tags like DST-related classes and discourse markers (most classes with about 40-80% of correct tags) or experimental tags (80%) were overall of not sufficient quality with some tags performing well and some below 70%.  The method is applicable to other domains and languages and shortens the time of dataset creation to a few hours/days if the dialog templates are provided. This was further verified with an Intent Detection task model with BERT embeddings where GPT 4o generated data used for training performed reasonably well when tested on two datasets created by language experts (F1: 0.78; 0.79) in comparison to training on those datasets and testing on the other sets (F1 for language experts created set: 0.87; 0.93; GPT 4o created set: 0.85; 0.82). It’s performance was also better than MultiDoGo corpora which when used both as training (F1: 0.61 0.58 0.65) and testing set (F1: 0.37 0.46 0.48) across the board showed lower result

  title: "Can clustering improve the performance of classifiers? Introduction of a new ensemble technique utilizing cluster analysis methods in classification tasks."
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Nowadays, the landscape of machine learning is rich with diverse solutions designed to tackle various challenges. While numerous solutions have been developed, significant performance improvements are often achieved through ensemble methods. Committees treat the entire dataset uniformly, without accounting for the fact that datasets usually contain highly diverse and varied subsets. The question arises if providing a successful method of grouping similar elements into clusters can improve the classification process ensuring a more tailored approach. This is why we introduce a new ensemble classification framework, which implements iterative model training. In this approach, we are focusing on finding a sequence of simple models that cover different clusters of data, in which they are particularly accurate. By generating a list of trained models and masks of incorrect predictions, we can optimally assign new data in an ensemble manner.  This approach may constitute a new method that contributes to the advancement of classification tasks with complex datasets. Introducing smart clustering into classification can bring significant benefits, such as a better understanding of data structure, reduction of noise, and more accurate model adaptation to the specifics of analyzed datasets.

  title: "Advanced Multi-Object Tracking and Classification of Cancer Cells with Transient Fluorescent Signals"
  author-title: "University of Cologne"
  abstract: >- 
    Monitoring cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique in biomedical research, facilitating an in-depth examination of cellular activities such as cell division and cell death. This method is particularly beneficial for single-cell analysis, especially in exploring how cancer cells respond to therapeutic drugs, as it yields critical information regarding the efficacy of these treatments.  Traditional approaches to cell tracking often rely on classical multi-object tracking (MOT) paradigms, where cells are first detected and then matched across frames. However, unlike conventional MOT challenges, which primarily address occlusion and changes in object appearance, cell tracking introduces unique challenges. This includes the detection of specific biological events, such as cell division or cell death. Furthermore, the tracking of entire cell lineages, even after division, is also essential.  For over a decade, state-of-the-art methods have been benchmarked using the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC), which focuses on 2D and 3D time-lapse microscopy videos. However, the datasets used in the CTC primarily emphasize the event of cell division, neglecting the critical event of cell death, which is crucial in single-cell analysis and understanding treatment effectiveness.  In this study, we utilize a dataset comprising videos captured with a long-term, high-temporal resolution microscope. Unlike standard approaches that track cells based on a single constant fluorescent signal, our dataset employs three different fluorescent markers, resulting in transient signals that complicate the tracking process. Moreover, our dataset includes sequences with both cell division and cell death, significantly increasing the challenge compared to conventional CTC sequences.  To address these challenges, we propose a deep-learning-based tracking method that simultaneously considers both cell division and cell death events. Our approach first detects cells using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture, which not only identifies cells in each frame but also classifies them as either living or dead. Following detection, we employ a multi-stage association method to match cells across successive frames. This method incorporates both high-confidence and low-confidence detections, allowing for the tracking of cells that are barely visible due to transient signals, as well as the recovery of lost detections.  Our method demonstrates robust performance, achieving an average Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 75% on the test set, despite the unprecedented challenges posed by transient signals and the inclusion of both cell division and cell death events. Additionally, we successfully track more than 90% of the cells for over 80% of their lifespan. These results highlight the novelty and effectiveness of our approach in tackling complex tracking conditions, setting a new benchmark for future research in single-cell analysis.

  title: "Ready, aim, edit! 🎯 Precise Parameter Localization for Text Editing with Diffusion Models"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Novel diffusion models (DMs) can synthesize photo-realistic images with integrated high-quality text. In this work, we demonstrate through attention activation patching that less than 0.5% of DMs' parameters influence the text generation within the images. In contrast to prior work, our localization approach is broadly applicable across various diffusion model architectures, including both U-Net and Transformer-based, utilizing diverse text encoders. Building on this observation, by precisely targeting specific parameters of the model, we improve the efficiency and performance of existing image-editing methods, which often inadvertently modify not only the text but also the other visual elements within an image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning solely the localized parameters enhances the general text-generation capabilities of large diffusion models, providing a more efficient fine-tuning approach.

  title: "Adaptive fill-in: how to mitigate the loss of an agent in decentralized federated learning"
  author-title: "Carnegie Mellon University, Poznan University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    In decentralized learning, agents collaborate by training models on their local data while regularizing based on information from their neighboring agents, aiming to achieve a common model and maximize overall performance. However, the permanent loss of an agent, especially one with unique knowledge about the data distribution (non-iid), can significantly degrade system performance.  To address this issue, we introduce a model-inversion technique as an adaptive fill-in strategy for agent reconstruction. This method reconstructs data points similar to those used by the lost agent during training and utilizes them to create and deploy a new agent, effectively restoring system performance and maintaining the optimization process.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various data distribution scenarios, including non-overlapping data distributions, distinct class assignments, and uniform distributions. Via experimental analysis, we show that our adaptive patching method not only recovers performance after a persistent agent failure but also accelerates convergence compared to other baseline approaches.

  title: "Smart sampling for object removal operations in Neural Radiance Fields"
  author-title: "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Poznan University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating immersive space representations. However, once trained, modifying these representations poses significant challenges due to the implicit storage of scene information within the weights of these coordinated neural networks. Existing approaches can be categorized into two main types: methods that modify the input dataset using inpainting techniques and methods that manipulate the density and sampling functions. The first category often involves time-consuming retraining, as edits cannot be applied to an already trained model without starting the training process anew. In contrast, the second category enables real-time editing without the need for model retraining. In the context of editing, the second category of methods provides significant flexibility, allowing for on-the-fly adjustments. However, object removal often results in distortions and artifacts in the scene behind the removed object. These distortions arise from na\"ive object removal techniques that suppress unwanted density function values, resulting in undersampled regions that should be reconstruced. Although the network properly encodes the knowledge of these regions, their reconstruction is impaired due to insufficient sampling. To address these issues, we propose a novel sampling technique that accounts for spatial regions containing the object to be removed and avoids sampling from these areas. Our approach focuses on sampling from regions underrepresented by existing methods, resulting in enhanced sampling of the regions behind the removed object. This technique mitigates distortion issues and improves the quality of rendered novel views. Additionally, our method reduces the number of samples required for successful rendering. Unlike other approaches, we demonstrate that our sampling strategy enables precise reconstruction of scene geometry, provided the network has seen the reconstructed regions from different angles during training. In cases where this is not possible, the network may exhibit hallucinations. However, it can still interpolate to approximate the geometry of the unseen regions.

  title: "Improved Scene Classification in Dynamic Combat Sports by Video Frame Segmentation"
  author-title: "University of Economics in Katowice"
  abstract: >- 
    #Abstract The current literature on image classification focuses on using images in which significant information objects contain a large part of the image. The problem of classifying images that contain significant objects over an area of only a few percent of the total image is largely ignored. This paper addresses the problem of classifying single video frames in which significant and informative objects contain less than 1.5% of the registered scene. Original video frames were used for the baseline approach, in addition, an algorithm for image segmentation was proposed, which for the balanced accuracy measure obtained an increase of 35 percentage points over the baseline approach.   #Introduction Cameras generate increasing amounts of data that cannot be analyzed manually. Thus, solutions are needed that will automatically provide valuable information about the recorded scene. Such a problem is addressed in the field of Computer Vision, where researchers have developed several algorithms for classifying the recorded scene.  The paper proposes an approach for segmenting an image before the classification process. The approach applies the operation of subtracting the n-th earliest frame recorded by the camera. Experiments proved that the approach for the balanced accuracy measure obtains an increase of 35 percentage points over the baseline approach using the original video frames.  #Experiments As part of the experiments, a binary classification of video frames was created, and the classifier was trained to classify a single frame into the "punch" or "no punch" class. The database contained 11,345 examples of the "punch" class and 100,614 examples of "no punch."  As part of the experiments, the proposed algorithm was tested for the set n = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34}, to compare the results and evaluate the impact of the proposed algorithm, a classifier was also trained on the original images(0_original approach). To train the classifiers the own convolutional neural network was used, with fewer convolutional layers and parameters compared to, for example, ResNet50 to speed up the training process. To statistically validate the results, the classifiers were trained and evaluated 30 times.   The proposed algorithm was compared with the 0_original baseline approach. In addition, three other algorithms from the literature were tested and evaluated during experiments: - Background subtraction based on K-nearest neighbours. - Background subtraction based on the Gaussian mixture. - Background subtraction based on BSUV-Net algorithm based on the convolution neural networks.

  title: "Seeing Through Their Eyes: Evaluating Visual Perspective Taking in Vision Language Models"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw, IDEAS NCBR, IMPAN"
  abstract: >- 
    Visual perspective-taking (VPT) is the ability to understand another person's viewpoint, allowing individuals to predict the actions of others. For example, a driver can avoid accidents by considering what pedestrians see. Humans generally develop this skill in early childhood, but it is unclear whether recently developed Vision Language Models (VLMs) have this ability. As these models are increasingly used in real-world applications, it is important to understand how they perform on complex tasks like VPT. In this paper, we introduce two manually curated datasets, called "Lego" and "Dots," to test VPT skills, and we use these datasets to evaluate 12 commonly used VLMs. We observe a significant drop in performance across all models when perspective-taking is required. Furthermore, we find that performance in object detection tasks does not strongly correlate with performance on VPT tasks, indicating that existing benchmarks may not be adequate for understanding this problem.

  title: "Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting Transformer Model: comparative analysis with statistical ARIMA method for short-term wind power prediction"
  author-title: "University College London (UCL) and True North Partners"
  abstract: >- 
    Despite the widespread use of transformer architectures in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, they have not yet become the state-of-the-art in wind-power time series forecasting, where statistical methods remain more popular. This research aims to bridge that gap by comparing the accuracy of wind power predictions using two approaches: a novel Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting Transformer Model and the traditional AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method.  By analyzing 134 time series from the SDWPF dataset and using three metrics—Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE), and Mean Arctangent Absolute Percentage Error (MAAPE)—I demonstrate that the transformer model consistently outperforms ARIMA. The transformer model shows higher accuracy across all metrics for most time series and exhibits less variation in performance between different time series.  These findings suggest that transformer models have significant potential for broader adoption in very short-term and short-term wind power forecasting.

  title: "BATTLE-AMP - Benchmarking Assessment Tests for The Leading Efficacy of Antimicrobial Peptides"
  author-title: "Computational Medicine Group, MIMUW"
  abstract: >- 
    Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a promising alternative to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, they have not been widely adopted in clinic due to their high toxicity and low activity. Therefore, discriminative methods are crucial to select AMP candidates with desired properties. The comparison of predictive models in AMP discovery is challenging and lacks consistency due to the absence of  standardized benchmarks. New methods are evaluated on custom datasets that are often not related to key AMP properties such as activity and are typically released in a manner that is difficult to reproduce. In this work we reviewed over 50 methods for AMP prediction and observed that code reproducibility was a significant challenge, with only 10 methods meeting our criteria for reproducibility. To address this fundamental problem, we propose an extendable framework for the systematic comparison of AMP prediction methods. We evaluated the robustness of these methods in key biological contexts, such as activity against specific species or adversarial syntactic variations. Our framework ensures higher reproducibility and plug-and-play assessment of new models, aiming to redefine AMP classification in a way that aligns more closely with the biological context.

  title: "Enhancing Solar Irradiance Forecasts with On-Device Continual Learning"
  author-title: "Poznan University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    With the increasing contribution of solar energy to the overall renewable energy system, accurate solar irradiance forecasting is crucial for optimizing energy production and managing grid stability. Traditional forecasting approaches rely on static and centralized algorithms that often struggle to adapt to local conditions and rapidly changing atmospheric phenomena. These limitations can lead to less stable and reliable forecasts, potentially undermining the consistency and efficiency of solar energy systems. Hence, we propose a novel approach to maintain the highest level of solar irradiance forecasting based on on-device continual learning. The presented solution leverages incoming data and an incremental learning strategy to continuously refine its forecasting skills directly on-site in a decentralized way, without constant communication with a central server. By combining new, relevant data samples with historical training data, our on-device continual learning pipeline can rapidly adjust to evolving environmental conditions, ensuring that the forecasting model remains accurate and responsive to local atmospheric changes. The developed pipeline improves the forecast accuracy of the deployed model, protects against catastrophic forgetting, and maintains this process energy efficient, relying only on the available constrained resources of edge devices. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of our method across various deployment scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in the precision and reliability of solar irradiance forecasts. Our results highlight the potential of on-device continual learning to advance solar irradiance forecasting, providing a scalable and adaptive solution to enhance energy management and facilitate more effective grid integration in the renewable energy sector.
