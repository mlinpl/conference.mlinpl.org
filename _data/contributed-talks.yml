  title: "Can individuals trust privacy mechanisms for machine learning? A case study of federated learning"
  author-title: "CISPA"
  abstract: >- 
    What is the trusted computing base for privacy? This talk will answer this question from the perspective of individual users. I will first focus on a case study of federated learning (FL). My work shows that vanilla FL currently does not provide meaningful privacy for individual users who cannot trust the central server orchestrating the FL protocol. This is because gradients of the shared model directly leak individual training data points.The resulting leakage can be amplified by a malicious attacker through small, targeted manipulations of the model weights. My work thus shows that the protection that vanilla FL claims to offer is but a thin facade: data may never "leave'' personal devices explicitly but it certainly does so implicitly through gradients. Then, I will show that the leakage is still exploitable for what is considered the most private instantiation of FL: a protocol that combines secure aggregation with differential privacy. This highlights that individuals unable to trust the central server should instead rely on verifiable mechanisms to obtain privacy. I will conclude my talk with an outlook on how such verifiable mechanisms can be designed in the future, as well as how my work generally advances the ability to audit privacy mechanisms. This work lays the foundation for approaches to model governance.

  title: "Privacy for Large Language Models"
  author-title: "University of Toronto / Vector Institute"
  abstract: >- 
    Large language models (LLMs) are excellent in-context learners. However, the sensitivity of data contained in prompts raises privacy concerns. Our work first shows that these concerns are valid: we instantiate a simple but highly effective membership inference attack against the data used to prompt LLMs. To address this vulnerability, one could forego prompting and resort to fine-tuning LLMs with known algorithms for private gradient descent. However, this comes at the expense of the practicality and efficiency offered by prompting. Therefore, we propose to privately learn to prompt. We first show that soft prompts can be obtained privately through gradient descent on downstream data. However, this is not the case for discrete prompts. Thus, we orchestrate a noisy vote among an ensemble of LLMs presented with different prompts, i.e., a flock of stochastic parrots. The vote privately transfers the flock's knowledge into a single public prompt. We show that LLMs prompted with our private algorithms closely match the non-private baselines. For example, using GPT3 as the base model, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 92.7% on the sst2 dataset with (ϵ=0.147,δ=10−6)-differential privacy vs. 95.2% for the non-private baseline. Through our experiments, we also show that our prompt-based approach is easily deployed with existing commercial APIs.

  title: "Bucks for Buckets (B4B): Active Defenses Against Stealing Encoders"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) APIs provide ready-to-use and high-utility encoders that generate vector representations for given inputs. Since these encoders are very costly to train, they become lucrative targets for model stealing attacks during which an adversary leverages query access to the API to replicate the encoder locally at a fraction of the original training costs. We propose Bucks for Buckets (B4B), the first active defense that prevents stealing while the attack is happening without degrading representation quality for legitimate API users. Our defense relies on the observation that the representations returned to adversaries who try to steal the encoder's functionality cover a significantly larger fraction of the embedding space than representations of legitimate users who utilize the encoder to solve a particular downstream task. B4B leverages this to adaptively adjust the utility of the returned representations according to a user's coverage of the embedding space. To prevent adaptive adversaries from eluding our defense by simply creating multiple user accounts (sybils), B4B also individually transforms each user's representations. This prevents the adversary from directly aggregating representations over multiple accounts to create their stolen encoder copy. Our active defense opens a new path towards securely sharing and democratizing encoders over public APIs.

  title: "Semi-supervised batch learning from logged data"
  author-title: "University College London"
  abstract: >- 
    Offline policy optimization methods aim to learn a policy from logged data which typically consists of context, action, propensity score, and reward for each sample point. In this work, we build on the counterfactual risk minimisation framework and we propose learning methods for settings where the rewards for some samples are not observed, so the logged data consists of a subset of samples with rewards and a subset of samples without rewards. This setting arises in many application domains, and we refer to it as semi-supervised batch learning. To approach this kind of learning problem, we derive new upper bounds on the true risk under the inverse propensity score estimator. We then build upon these bounds to propose a regularized counterfactual risk minimization method where the regularization term is reward independent and hence can be evaluated on the without-rewards data. We also propose another algorithm based on generating pseudo rewards for the logged without-rewards dataset. Thus, while reward feedback is present for some samples only, it is possible to leverage the without-reward samples in order to learn a policy that minimizes the risk. Experimental results with neural networks and logged data examples derived from benchmark datasets indicate that these algorithms can output policies that have smaller risk than the logging policy.

  title: "TreeFlow: A Novel Tree-Based Approach for Flexible Regression Modeling with Normalizing Flows"
  author-title: "DataWalk / Wrocław University of Science and Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Tree-based ensembles have long been acknowledged for their exceptional performance in handling classification and regression tasks involving mixed-type variables from diverse domains and ranges. However, in regression problems, they traditionally offer deterministic responses or model output uncertainty using Gaussian or parametric distributions. To overcome these limitations, we present TreeFlow, an innovative approach that seamlessly integrates the strengths of tree ensembles with the adaptability of modeling complex probability distributions using normalizing flows.
    
    In this work, we propose a methodology that leverages a tree-based model as a feature extractor, which is subsequently combined with a conditional variant of normalizing flow. By doing so, our approach gains the unique capability of effectively modeling intricate and multi-modal target distributions for regression outputs. To assess the effectiveness of TreeFlow, we conduct extensive evaluations on challenging regression benchmarks with varying data volumes, feature characteristics, and target dimensionalities.
    
    Our experimental results demonstrate that TreeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in both probabilistic and deterministic metrics on datasets featuring multi-modal target distributions. Furthermore, when compared to traditional tree-based regression baselines, TreeFlow delivers competitive results on datasets with unimodal target distributions. Overall, our novel TreeFlow approach represents a significant advancement in the realm of flexible regression modeling, offering promising avenues for tackling complex real-world problems requiring probabilistic output predictions.

  title: "Double  logistic regression approach to biased positive-unlabeled data"
  author-title: "Polish Academy of Sciences / Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Positive and unlabelled learning is an important nonstandard
    inference problem which arises naturally in many applications. 
    The significant limitation of almost all existing methods addressing it lies in assuming that the propensity score function is constant and does not depend on features (Selected Completely at Random assumption), which is unrealistic in many practical situations. Avoiding this assumption, we consider parametric approach to the
    problem of joint estimation of posterior probability and propensityscore functions.We show that if both these functions are logistic with different parameters (double logistic model) then the corresponding parameters are identifiable. Motivated by this, we propose two approaches
    to their estimation: a joint maximum likelihood method and the second approach based on an alternating maximization of two Fisher consistent approximations. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods perform on par or better than the existing
    methods based on Expectation-Maximisation scheme.

  abstract: >- 
    Classical approaches for robotic perception are not sufficient, when robots operate in changing environments. If the suroundings are not perceived accurately, the misinformation is propagated to navigation resulting in inefficient behaviour. It is possible for the robot to learn from the past experiences however the variety of industrial environments makes it difficult to develop a scalable learning system which is universal in various settings. In this talk I will presents approaches for generating vast learning datasets from limited real recordings and synthetic data that can be used for learning deep understanding of surrounding objects. The system we developed is able to generate big datasets with realistic representations and use them directly for perception tasks such as segmentation and footprint estimation. In our work we evaluated proposed approach both with data originating from real sensors and in the context of limited computational resources.

  abstract: >- 
    With the growing interest in space exploration, challenges are also increasing. Recent years have witnessed a notable surge in the advancement of space robotics, particularly pertaining to Moon exploration. The incorporation of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices in this domain has expedited both research and development endeavours. It also enables equipping satellites, rovers and landers in deep-learning accelerators and edge AI devices. Their usage allows not only for onboard data processing and reduction of data transfer, but can also help in the decision-making process, instilling elements of autonomy. 
    In our project, we employ deep learning for space robotics by using an image segmentation model of the lunar environment.  This network, designed for rock segmentation, was deployed on an FPGA accelerator board, thereby enabling efficient and low-power processing of rover-captured images directly onboard. The solution was validated in the analogue lunar research station.

    In this talk, I will introduce the main topics of my research group dedicated to developing sustainable computer vision methods for autonomous machines, where we assume device limitations and a variety of sensors. After the short overview, I will present our research on active visual exploration, which addresses the issue of limited sensor capabilities in real-world scenarios, where successive observations are actively chosen based on the environment. For this purpose, I will describe our technique called Attention-Map Entropy (AME) that we recently published at IJCAI. It leverages the internal uncertainty of the transformer-based model to determine the most informative observations. Unlike the existing solutions, it does not require additional loss components, which simplifies the training and significantly improves the performance of reconstruction, segmentation, and classification on publicly available datasets.

  abstract: >- 
    Continual Learning is an emerging paradigm in machine learning where models learn new tasks in sequence without access to previously acquired knowledge. The key challenge in this field is addressing the problem of catastrophic forgetting of previous information. This is crucial because models must adapt to constantly evolving data and tasks in many real-world scenarios. During this presentation, I will discuss the latest developments in Continual Learning research and draw the connection to test-time adaptation, which allows the initial model to adapt to data distribution changes without any supervision. Finally, I will present our research results with self-adapting models for visual recognition in autonomous driving scenarios.

  title: "Class Fitting in Residual Convolutional Networks"
  author-title: "AGH University of Science and Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    We leverage probabilistic models of neural representations to investigate how residual networks fit classes. To this end, we estimate class-conditional density models for representations learned by deep ResNets. We then use these models to characterize distributions of representations across learned classes. Surprisingly, we find that classes in the investigated models are not fitted in a uniform way. On the contrary: we uncover two groups of classes that are fitted with markedly different distributions of representations. These distinct modes of class-fitting are evident only in the deeper layers of the investigated models, indicating that they are not related to low-level image features. We show that the uncovered structure in neural representations correlate with memorization of training examples and adversarial robustness. Finally, we compare class-conditional distributions of neural representations between memorized and typical examples. This allows us to uncover where in the network structure class labels arise for memorized and standard inputs.

  abstract: >- 
    In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, Allegro is constantly seeking ways to harness the power of Machine Learning (ML) efficiently. Central to our efforts is the challenge of building ML pipelines that can deliver personalized recommendations to our vast user base. This presentation will share our journey in mastering these pipelines at a scale that's both practical and impactful.
    
    While the world of ML offers many tools, working at a "Reasonable Scale" has its hurdles. Unlike tech giants with virtually limitless resources, most enterprises don't have the luxury of processing billions of data points daily, hiring endless talent, or leveraging infinite computing power. At Allegro, we have to be smart with our resources. We often face challenges like ensuring consistent data quality across diverse sources, managing the intricacies of deployment without the luxury of vast dedicated teams, or the need to make quick recommendations with the computing power we have available. Adapting to new ML techniques while keeping our systems efficient is a constant balancing act.
    
    This talk will dive deep into the challenges of doing ML at a reasonable scale. Through Allegro's experiences, we aim to show that with the right strategies, even mid-sized operations can achieve great ML outcomes.

  title: "Unlocking Scientific Discoveries with Large Language Models in Astronomy"
  author-title: "Australian National University"
  abstract: >- 
    Recent advances in understanding, generating, and interpreting human language have brought Large Language Models (LLMs) to the forefront of research. Intrigued by their potential, we have focused on utilizing LLMs for hypothesis generation within the field of astronomy—a domain that serves as an ideal platform for integrating machine learning. This suitability stems from the field's vast, publicly available datasets, limited privacy concerns, and an abundant corpus of expert literature. Our initiative, UniverseTBD, is a multidisciplinary collaboration that includes approximately 30 active contributors and partners with the core team of NASA's ADS server, a primary data repository for astronomers.
    
    Our objectives are twofold: to enhance information retrieval through improved semantic representation and to pioneer new frontiers in hypothesis generation. Our expert team of astronomers acts as human evaluators, employing their domain expertise to assess the quality of the hypotheses generated by the models.
    
    Our efforts are coordinated around two pivotal activities: (a) fine-tuning existing large-scale models, primarily LLaMA, with a comprehensive corpus of astronomy literature from arXiv, and (b) exploring various instruction-based learning techniques to build upon these refined models. Noteworthy outcomes include a marked improvement in the quality of generated hypotheses, thanks to adversarial prompting that employs teacher and student models. We have also implemented classifier-free guidance and negative prompting to enhance the robustness and diversity of hypothesis generation. Through rigorous human evaluations, we've shown that our machine-generated hypotheses are beginning to match human-level quality.
    
    We believe our work will become an invaluable resource for early-career researchers and smaller academic institutions, thereby democratizing access to specialized expertise in astronomy.

Here, we report substantially improved antibiotic resistance prediction from DNA sequences through the introduction of a novel deep learning architecture called GeneBac. We show that by leveraging the DNA sequence information and gene regulatory interactions in a bacterial strain, GeneBac is capable of accurately predicting minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to multiple drugs, which allows for a more accurate diagnosis and is a substantial improvement to existing methods that predict a binary label. Furthermore, GeneBac learned to predict the effect of previously unseen genetic variants, which is crucial considering the rapid rate of mutation in bacteria. GeneBac achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks, including antibiotic resistance, variant effect and gene expression prediction on two distinct bacterial species; Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Finally, we show how the modular architecture of GeneBac allows for transfer learning across modalities, leading to improved performance.

  title: "Deep spatial context - digital pathology"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Neural networks find application in the processing of histopathological images. However, it comes with some challenges. One of the most popular approaches is an attention-based model. In the talk, the Deep Spatial Context method will be presented, which was inspired by the need to analyse whether the behaviour of the trained models aligns with the histopathologists' good practices that take into account contextual information. The proposed Spatial Context Measures allow a quantitative measurement of the role of the spatial context.

  title: "Artificial Intelligence for non-invasive cardiac diagnostics"
  author-title: "Hemolens Diagnostics"
  abstract: >- 
    The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in cardiovascular imaging is revolutionizing the field of coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnostics. In recent years, in the domain of computed tomography angiography (CTA), a fractional flow reserve (FFR) derived from coronary CTA using computational fluid dynamics, has been used as a compelling, non-invasive, in-silico replacement for invasive diagnostic techniques. The patient-specific hemodynamic features, and in particular the FFR in coronary arteries is an essential step in providing personalized and accurate diagnosis of CAD. This talk delves into the impactful use of AI to augment cardiovascular disease diagnosis, with a focus on the innovative CenterlinePointNet++ architecture (accepted to MICCAI 2023), which is a new point cloud based architecture for patient-specific, coronary artery hemodynamic features estimation.

  title: "The State of Polish Semantic Search in the Era of LLMs"
  author-title: "IPI PAN"
  abstract: >- 
    As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain popularity, concerns about hallucination are becoming more prevalent. One effective approach to addressing this issue is to augment the prompt with related documents, allowing LLMs to rely on existing information rather than generating facts. However, the challenge is to identify relevant documents efficiently and accurately. In this talk, I will give an overview of the Polish semantic search field. I will discuss the existing models and their training datasets, present the new models, and share insights from the PolEval competition challenge, which focused on tackling this problem.

  title: "Steering Language Generation: Harnessing Contrastive Guidance and Negative Prompting for Coherent and Diverse Synthetic Data Generation"
  author-title: "The Australian National University"
  abstract: >- 
    Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential to generate synthetic data of high quality and utility, which has numerous applications from downstream model training to practical data utilisation. However, contemporary models, despite their impressive capacities, consistently struggle to produce both coherent and diverse data. To address this, we introduce an innovative approach that employs classifier-free contrastive guidance and negative prompting for inference-time logit reshaping. Our approach systematically guides the LLMs to strike a balance between adherence to the data distribution (ensuring semantic fidelity) and deviation from prior synthetic examples or existing real datasets (ensuring diversity and authenticity). Our key contribution lies in this delicate balancing act, achieved by dynamically moving towards or away from chosen representations in the latent space. We evaluate our method using principles from minimum set theory, abstracting metrics for precision, recall, and authenticity. Using these metrics, our method demonstrates superior performance to previous data generation techniques across all dimensions of fidelity, diversity, and authenticity in three distinct tasks. Our findings underscore the universality and effectiveness of our approach, positioning it as a generalisable algorithm in synthetic data generation that fully capitalises on the strengths of LLMs.

  abstract: >- 
    Large deep learning models often require memory far in excess of processing units typically available. This presents unique challenges in fine-tuning models with a large number of parameters. We aim to discuss the group of memory optimization techniques such as low-rank adaptation, quantization etc applicable to models like the recent LLMs. These techniques are scattered across the literature and this talk attempts to bring them together in an attempt to discuss how these may allow us to use large models in single/multiple GPU settings for custom experiments.

  title: "What AI developers need to know about AI governance"
  author-title: "Pearson"
  abstract: >- 
    Research shows that AI governance is a key impediment to the adoption of AI solutions, and the landscape is becoming increasingly complex in 2023. Around the world, governments are enacting regulations that impose data and algorithmic transparency obligations on AI providers, while courts are setting landmark precedents in AI copyright law.
    
    This complexity poses a considerable risk, especially for institutions and startups that lack the resources for legal consultation at every stage of a project. A single poor decision can derail months-long, multi-million-dollar initiatives. Therefore, this talk aims to provide attendees with the essential knowledge to navigate the evolving landscape of AI governance and mitigate such risks.
    
    We will start by delving into software licenses, addressing such questions as: To what extent can a 'research-only' open-source model be used in a for-profit setting? What are the caveats in reusing an open-source model published under a commercial license if the original training data was not commercially licensed? Do you retain copyright when using AI coding assistants?
    
    Next, we will address the challenges associated with model training data. This will encompass emerging legal interpretations on copyright infringement for using publicly available data and recent challenges from data protection regulators regarding the scraping of publicly available data as a violation of privacy rights. We will also tackle the decision-making process for releasing your own data, exploring what types of licenses facilitate reusability.
    
    Finally, we will examine the regulatory landscape for model deployment, focusing on Article 28b of the European Union's upcoming AI Act. We will cover the practical implications of this act, such as how open-source models are more likely to meet these regulatory requirements and how substantial alterations to a model could reclassify you as the provider, thereby imposing new regulatory obligations.
    
    While the exact answers to these questions will inevitably vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances, attendees will leave the session better equipped to spot and mitigate potential red flags.

  title: "First full report on the state of AI adoption in law"
  author-title: "AnyLawyer Corporation / National Centre for Nuclear Research"
  abstract: >- 
    In 2023, the legal sector faces several challenges, including stagnating wages, rising operational costs, and decreasing productivity. Compounded by the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, these issues have accelerated the industry's need for innovation. Concurrently, the rapid advancement of generative AI technologies has begun to significantly influence service sectors, including law.
    
    We conducted a comprehensive study to gauge the state and future of AI adoption in the legal field. Over 1,000 interviews were carried out with lawyers worldwide, resulting in 200 law firms completing surveys. The respondents predominantly held key decision-making positions related to technology and innovation within their organizations. Collectively, the surveyed firms employed around 400,000 individuals, including 50,000 lawyers, providing a representative global perspective.
    
    The data suggests that generative AI has the potential to substantially disrupt the legal sector within the next three years. Projections indicate that AI could be responsible for approximately 40% of legal tasks in the near future. This technological integration offers significant financial benefits, enabling firms to perform more efficiently and effectively, thereby solidifying their market positions.
    
    The benefits of AI adoption extend beyond financial gains. The technology promises to automate routine tasks, enhance efficiency, and thereby improve client services. The increased efficiency could allow firms to handle a higher volume of legal matters in shorter periods, reinforcing their market leadership.
    
    In summary, the study underscores the imminent and transformative impact of AI technology on the legal industry. Widespread AI adoption could lead to substantial financial and operational advantages for law firms, as well as increased efficiency within the legal process. As AI becomes an integral part of the legal landscape, proficiency in this technology will be increasingly critical for practitioners in the field.
    
    The full report will be published in late September 2023.

  title: "The impact of modern Large Language Models in the EdTech industry"
  author-title: "Brainly"
  abstract: >- 
    2023 will be remembered as the year of the LLM battle among tech companies such as OpenAI, Google, Meta, Nvidia, smaller competitors such as Anthropic, CoHere, as well as other open source initiatives.
    All of those organizations competing to release a better, larger, more reliable model able to generate text contents.
    Those modern models are still based on the Transformer architecture, which was already available over the last 5 years and gave birth to BERT and related solutions that quickly conquered the NLP adoption in almost every industry.
    Thus, how modern language models are different compared from the previous generation of transformers? What does “large” mean? Are we at the dawn of a new chapter for generative AI? What are the impacts and new opportunities for educators and technology providers?
    
    In this talk, we will cover an overview of the state of the art of large language models, insights from the educational domain at Brainly, how the data science and engineering approaches are evolving into new paradigms, and we will share some simple tips and best practices to build question answering applications that provide education values to the learners.

  abstract: >- 
    The proposed presentation concerns the new solutions for localization with multi-sensory systems, starting with the challenges of multi-sensory localization solutions from exact extrinsic calibration to non-usual sensory stacks. We will discuss camera-3D LiDAR spatiotemporal calibration through bus calibration, multi-sensory place recognition, and haptic localization. The presented solutions create a unified series of works, each based on experiences from previous approaches, even if the application is different. The proposed methods are practical localization solutions or their components that can be a part of the autonomous agents.

  title: "The story of explainable clustering"
  author-title: "Bocconi University"
  abstract: >- 
    This will be a talk about the problem of explainable clustering in the setting first formalized by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (ICML 2020). A k-clustering is said to be explainable if it is given by a decision tree where each internal node splits data points with a threshold cut in a single dimension (feature), and each of the k leaves corresponds to a cluster. I will present an algorithm that outputs an explainable clustering that loses at most a factor of log k compared to an optimal (not necessarily explainable) clustering for the k-medians objective – which is provably a necessary price to pay for explainability. The algorithm is remarkably simple and elegant. In particular, given an initial (not necessarily explainable) clustering in d dimensions, it is oblivious to the data points and runs in time ~O(dk), independent of the number of data points n. The talk will be based on our joint work with Buddhima Gamlath, Xinrui Jia, and Ola Svensson, as well as other works in the area.

  title: "Towards Efficient Machine Learning for Sequential Decision Making"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw / Altos Labs"
  abstract: >-
    In this talk, I will present my personal journey toward developing efficient machine learning methods for sequential decision making. This journey spans both academia and industry, tackling diverse challenges that range from Atari games to autonomous driving and robotics.
    Why should we care about efficient methods for sequential decision making? If we observe the progress of artificial intelligence over the last few decades, it has managed to ascend what were perceived as pinnacles of human intelligence. From chess and Go to StarCraft and No Limit Texas Hold'em, machines have toppled human champions. The emergence of large language models extends this progress to more open-ended challenges.
    Despite these successes, when it comes to physical interactions with the real world, the achievements of AI are less remarkable. For instance, despite three decades of research, multi-fingered robotic hands are still far less dexterous than those of an average human child. The comparatively slower advancements in the realm of physical interactions can largely be attributed to the massive data requirements of contemporary machine learning methods. Advancements in efficiency could pave the way for truly practical robots capable of alleviating our household chores, rather than just beating us in games or eyeing our jobs.
