- title: AlleNoise - large-scale text classification benchmark dataset with real-world label noise
  abstract: >-
    Label noise remains a challenge for training robust classification models, as it might negatively impact their classification performance. To help with the development of new algorithms, we've published AlleNoise, a curated text classification dataset with real-world instance-dependent label noise. In this presentation, we will show how we've evaluated existing robust classification methods and argue why they are ill-equipped for handling such realistic noise patterns.

- title: LLM Serving
  abstract: >-
    The presentation Scaling and Optimizing LLM Serving focuses on techniques for efficiently deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) to meet performance demands. It covers key fundamentals like prefill, decoding, and memory optimization, and explains the importance of metrics such as latency, throughput, and cost. The talk compares popular model-serving frameworks (vLLM, Hugging Face Text Generation Inference, and Nvidia TensorRT-LLM), highlighting their advantages and limitations. It also introduces optimization techniques, including quantization, batching, and memory management strategies like PagedAttention, and concludes with recommendations for selecting the right hardware and server configurations to maximize LLM efficiency and scalability.

- title: Leveraging Feature Store for high-sparsity recommendations in LOT Polish Airlines
  abstract: >-
    Recommendation systems are an essential part of most e-commerce industries, often responsible for a significant portion of revenue. However, every branch of this industry has its own set of exceptions and challenges that affect how recommender systems have to be designed. In airlines, these exceptions become extreme as returning visitors become sparse, many purchases are anonymous, and items, such as flight tickets, can be sold at different prices depending on the circumstances. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple method that utilizes information collected about users and items, omitting the need for extracting user/item embeddings with matrix factorization. Additionally, we will talk about how we used a Feature Store as a foundation for this project and why it could be beneficial to implement it in your Data Science team as well.
