- title: AlleNoise - large-scale text classification benchmark dataset with real-world label noise
  abstract: >-
    Label noise remains a challenge for training robust classification models, as it might negatively impact their classification performance. To help with the development of new algorithms, we've published AlleNoise, a curated text classification dataset with real-world instance-dependent label noise. In this presentation, we will show how we've evaluated existing robust classification methods and argue why they are ill-equipped for handling such realistic noise patterns.
