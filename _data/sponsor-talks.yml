- title: TRANSLATING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH INTO IMPACTFUL PRODUCTS
  abstract: >-
    The ongoing AI revolution profoundly reshapes our world. However, translating cutting-edge research into impactful products in a timely manner presents a significant challenge. At Snowflake, we bridge the gap between pioneering AI research and practical application, delivering user-friendly, reliable, and scalable solutions for data scientists, engineers, and researchers. This presentation will highlight these innovative products, with a special focus on the development of our latest Arctic-Extract model for unstructured data processing. Arctic-Extract significantly surpasses the capabilities of our previous DocumentAI model, achieving state-of-the-art results on documents up to 125 pages with minimal GPU memory requirements.

- title: "Measuring What Matters: The Challenges of Evaluating and Optimizing LLMs"
  abstract: >-
    From fine-tuning to prompt engineering, LLM adaptation is evolving fast - but knowing whether an optimized model is "good enough" remains a challenge. This talk focuses on the pitfalls of LLM evaluation and shares practical strategies for comparing full-precision and optimized models, especially when the process must be automated without human judgment in the loop.

- title: Sequential Representation Learning for Real-Time Bidding
  abstract: >-
    In this talk, we present our ongoing work on integrating large-scale sequential user modeling into real-time bidding (RTB) systems ‚Äî a domain where extreme latency constraints typically prevent the use of computationally intensive architectures. We will begin with a short introduction to online advertising, outlining the key machine learning challenges that arise in high-throughput bidding environments. We then describe how we leverage transformer-based architectures trained on whole-web traffic to enrich user profiles and enhance downstream prediction models. Finally, we showcase how these representations can be deployed within production-grade RTB pipelines without violating strict performance requirements.
