    Sara Magliacane is an assistant professor in the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab at the University of Amsterdam and an ELLIS Scholar in the Interactive Learning and Interventional Representations program. During Spring 2022, she visited the Simons Institute in Berkeley for a semester on Causality.
    The goal of her research is to find how causality can improve current machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially in terms of robustness, generalization across domains/tasks, and safety. Her research focuses on three directions: causal representation learning (i.e. learning causal factors from high-dimensional data, e.g. sequences of images), causal discovery (i.e. learning causal relations from data), and causality-inspired ML, e.g. how can ideas from causality help ML/RL adapt to new domains, nonstationarity and varying number of objects with different latent parameters, even when we cannot guarantee that we identified the true causal factors.
    Previously, she was a Research Scientist at MIT-IBM Watson AI lab and a postdoctoral researcher at IBM Research NY, working on methods to design experiments that would allow one to learn causal relations in a sample-efficient and intervention-efficient way. She received a PhD at VU Amsterdam on learning causal relations jointly from different experimental settings, even with latent confounders and small samples. During her PhD, she interned at Google Zürich and NYC. Previously, she studied Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and Torino and at the University of Trieste.

- name: Johannes Brandstetter

    Johannes Brandstetter is leading the group “AI for data-driven simulations” at the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz. Additionally, he is a Co-founder and Chief Scientist at Emmi AI — a push towards the data-driven revolution in science and engineering.
    He obtained his PhD after working several years at the CMS experiment at CERN. During this time, he had the privilege of learning from brilliant minds from all around the world and had the chance to co-author seminal papers in the realm of Higgs boson physics. In 2018, after completing his PhD, his career trajectory shifted towards machine learning, and he was fortunate to join the research group of Mr. LSTM, Sepp Hochreiter, in Linz. Under Sepp’s mentorship, he delved into the intricacies of machine learning and modern deep learning over a span of 2.5 years.
    From 2021 to 2023, he spent three remarkable years in Amsterdam. Initially, he was part of the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab led by Max Welling, and subsequently joined Microsoft Research for two years. During this period, his passion for Geometric Deep Learning — particularly involving Geometric (Clifford) algebras — and his interest in partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on developing neural surrogates for PDEs, became profound. Most importantly, he pivoted towards large-scale PDEs, including weather and climate modeling, which culminated in Aurora.
    His years in Amsterdam have shaped his research vision. He is firmly convinced that AI is on the cusp of disrupting simulations at industry scale. Every day, thousands and thousands of compute hours are spent on turbulence modeling, simulations of fluid or air flows, heat transfer in materials, traffic flows, and many more. Many of these processes follow similar underlying patterns, yet require different and extremely specialized software to simulate. Even worse, for different parameter settings, the costly simulations need to be run at full length from scratch.
    This is what he wants to change. Therefore, he has started a new group at JKU Linz which has strong computer vision, numerical simulation, and engineering components. The group aims to advance data-driven simulations at industry scale and to place the Austrian industry engine Linz as a center for doing that.
