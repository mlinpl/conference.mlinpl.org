    Bernardino is a researcher at Google DeepMind, where he has been a core team member of AlphaFold2 for protein folding, and AlphaTensor for matrix multiplication algorithms. More recently, he initiated FunSearch, a system which uses Large Language Models for program search and has discovered new mathematical knowledge. Long before that, in 2009, Bernardino started his AI journey by studying the MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL. In 2010 he started a PhD, also at UCL, supervised by Prof. Massimiliano Pontil and Prof. Nadia Berthouze, and in 2013 he also did an internship at Microsoft Research. After finishing his PhD in 2014, he joined the Torr Vision Group as a Postdoc at the University of Oxford, researching about semantic segmentation and zero-shot learning. He has several papers published in Nature, as well as in machine learning conferences like NeurIPS and ICML. His main motivation is to leverage the power of AI to bring light to important scientific problems.
