  bio: |- 
    Prof. Alejandro Frangi FREng, holds the Bicentennial Turing Chair in Computational Medicine at the University of Manchester, UK, with joint appointments in the Schools of Computer Science and Health Science. Additionally, he is the Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies, specialising in Precision Computational Medicine for in silico trials of medical devices. He serves as the Director of the Christabel Pankhurst Institute for Health Technology Research and Innovation and is a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. Recently, his research vision was recognised with an ERC Advanced Grant from the European Research Council. He leads the InSilicoUK Pro-Innovation Regulations Network (www.insilicouk.org). 
    
    Professor Frangi's main research interests lie at the crossroads of medical image analysis and modelling with an emphasis on machine learning (phenomenological models) and computational physiology (mechanistic models). His work has had a profound impact on the field, particularly in the areas of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurosciences. He is particularly interested in statistical methods applied to population imaging and in silico clinical trials. 
    
    Prof. Frangi's contributions to the field have been widely recognised. He has received numerous accolades, including the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Technical Achievement Award (2021) and Early Career Award (2006). In 2011, he was honored with the UPF Medal for his service as Dean of the Escuela Politècnica Superior. He also received the ICREA-Academia Prize from the Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA) in 2008, a President's International Initiative Award from the Chinese Academy of Science in 2019. Prof. Frangi has also edited a textbook on Medical Image Analysis, published in the MICCAI-Elsevier Book Series by Academic Press.

  bio: >-
    Bernardino is a researcher at Google DeepMind, where he has been a core team member of AlphaFold2 for protein folding, and AlphaTensor for matrix multiplication algorithms. More recently, he initiated FunSearch, a system which uses Large Language Models for program search and has discovered new mathematical knowledge. Long before that, in 2009, Bernardino started his AI journey by studying the MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL. In 2010 he started a PhD, also at UCL, supervised by Prof. Massimiliano Pontil and Prof. Nadia Berthouze, and in 2013 he also did an internship at Microsoft Research. After finishing his PhD in 2014, he joined the Torr Vision Group as a Postdoc at the University of Oxford, researching about semantic segmentation and zero-shot learning. He has several papers published in Nature, as well as in machine learning conferences like NeurIPS and ICML. His main motivation is to leverage the power of AI to bring light to important scientific problems.
