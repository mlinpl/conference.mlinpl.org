  title: "Real-Time Omnidirectional 3D Multi-Person Human Pose Estimation with Occlusion Handling"
  author-title: "University of Southampton / University of Freiburg"
  abstract: >- 
    Current human pose estimation systems primarily focus on obtaining an accurate 3D global estimate of a single person. Our work introduces one of the first real-time 3D multi-person human pose estimation systems capable of handling basic forms of occlusion. First, we adapt an off-the-shelf 2D detector and an unsupervised 2D-3D lifting model for use with 360° panoramic camera and mmWave radar sensors. We then make several key contributions, including camera and radar calibrations and improved matching of individuals between image and radar spaces.  Our system addresses the depth and scale ambiguity problems by utilizing a lightweight 2D-3D pose lifting algorithm that operates in real-time with high accuracy in both indoor and outdoor environments, providing an affordable and scalable solution. Notably, the system maintains nearly constant time complexity regardless of the number of detected individuals, achieving a frame rate of approximately 7-8 fps on a laptop with a commercial-grade GPU.  My presentation and poster will feature material from our initial paper, which proposed the system and was presented at the ACM SIGGRAPH European Conference on Visual Media Production in December 2023. I will also cover our second paper, which details system improvements and was presented in January 2024 at the International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communication. Additionally, I will reference my latest article, "Human Modelling and Pose Estimation Overview," available on arXiv. All these resources can be found on my webpage: pawelknap.github.io.

  title: "Accumulated Local Effects and Graph Neural Networks"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw, MIM Faculty / IPPT PAN"
  abstract: >- 
    I explore how Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), a model-agnostic explanation method, can be tailored to visualize the impact of node features in link prediction tasks in Graph Neural Networks (GNN). A key challenge addressed in this work is the fact that complex interactions of nodes during message passing within GNN layers complicate the direct application of ALE. Since a straightforward solution of modyfying only one node at once would substantially increase computation time, I propose an approximate method that mitigates this challenge.  The findings reveal that although the approximate method offers computational efficiency, the exact method yields more stable explanations, particularly when smaller data subsets are used. However, when a large number of data points are employed to estimate the ALE profile, the differences between the two methods diminish. Additionally, I discuss how different parameters influence the accuracy of ALE estimation for both methods.

  title: "Interrogating Time Series Foundation Models"
  author-title: "Carnegie Mellon University / Poznan University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Time series foundation models have shown significant adaptability across various tasks and domains, providing powerful tools for analyzing and predicting temporal data. These models offer easy-to-use and powerful tools for analyzing and predicting temporal data across diverse applications, from finance to healthcare. However, large scale, in terms of both parameters and training data, poses challenges in evaluating their limitations and determining appropriate use cases. The rapid evolution of this field raises questions about the optimal architecture and training data composition, as well as the mechanisms employed for time series processing. Furthermore, to responsibly deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to understand their limitations and potential failure points, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.   To address these knowledge gaps, we introduce Time Series Interrogator, a novel framework for analyzing time series foundation models, leveraging representation analysis and mechanistic interpretability techniques. Our study applies it to multiple publicly available models, offering a comparative analysis of their learned representations and underlying processes. This approach not only provides insights into the workings of time series foundation models, but also paves the way for more informed model development and application. By elucidating these complex systems, our work contributes to the responsible advancement of time series analysis, enabling researchers and practitioners to harness the full potential of foundation models while understanding their inherent strengths and limitations.

  title: "Harnessing YouTube for evaluating general-purpose speech recognition machine learning models"
  author-title: "Jagiellonian University"
  abstract: >- 
    Speech recognition has become a critical component in numerous applications, ranging from virtual assistants and transcription services to voice-controlled devices and accessibility tools. The increasing reliance on speech recognition machine learning models requires robust and comprehensive evaluation methodologies to ensure their performance, reliability, and adaptability across diverse scenarios. In our research, we propose YouTube as a data source to evaluate speech recognition models by utilizing the audio from the videos and the subtitles added to them. YouTube offers a rich and continuously updated collection of spoken language data, encompassing various languages, accents, dialects, speaking styles, and audio quality levels. This makes it an ideal source of data which can be used to evaluate the adaptability and performance of speech recognition models in real-world situations.   For the purposes of research we created a tool named Mi-Go to help collect data, evaluate models and store results. The experiment that we conducted on open-source models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2 and others) highlights the utility of YouTube as a valuable data source for evaluation of speech recognition models, ensuring their robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to diverse languages and acoustic conditions. Additionally, by contrasting the machine-generated transcriptions against human-made subtitles, the experiments can help pinpoint potential misuse of YouTube subtitles, like search engine optimization.

  title: "Cherish Every MOMENT"
  author-title: "FU Berlin / CMU"
  abstract: >- 
    Time Series Foundation Models represent a new paradigm for modeling time series data across a variety of tasks and domains with minimal supervision. To simplify pre-training, many foundation models are designed to accept univariate time series of a fixed length as input. However, real-world time series can be both long and multivariate, which limits the widespread adoption of these models. In this paper, we focus on developing effective techniques to expand the context length of time series models, enabling them to handle both long and multivariate time series. We evaluate how extending the context window impacts downstream task performance in both classification and long-horizon forecasting. Additionally, we explore methods to createa multivariate Time Series Foundation Model.

  title: "Towards Sustainable Cloud Environments by Leveraging Time Series Forecasting for Enhanced Resource Utilization"
  author-title: "AGH University of Kraków"
  abstract: >- 
    The increasing importance of cloud computing underscores its undeniable flexibility, which renders it indispensable in modern organizations. However, the operational model inherent in cloud environments carries significant risks that can impact both cost-effectiveness and energy utilization. While the pay-as-you-go pricing scheme provides a convenient interface for accessing cloud resources, expenses can escalate uncontrollably. Ensuring top-notch QoS (Quality of Service) and steering clear of SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations often involves provisioning more resources than necessary, leaving a considerable margin of unused cloud capacity. While overprovisioning leads to resource wastage and higher costs, underprovisioning risks service downtime. As cloud computing continues to grow in scale and complexity, optimizing resource utilization is crucial for achieving environmental sustainability. Moreover, improving resource management aligns with the principles of GCC (Green Cloud Computing) and sustainable computing.  Therefore, machine learning-based resource usage prediction emerges as a significant optimization category. However, workload patterns in cloud environments are influenced by various factors, resulting in time series data that represent historical resource usage characterized by complex, multi-seasonal dependencies and considerable variability. Consequently, introducing a cloud resource usage optimization system tackles the issue of inefficient resource utilization by applying long-term time-series forecasting within the cloud computing domain to generate dynamic resource reservation plans based on predicted demand.  Due to the multi-faceted nature of system architecture, the thematic scope covers various aspects, such as the role of exploratory data analysis combined with unsupervised anomaly detection, the critical importance of leveraging cloud FinOps (Financial Operations) principles, the evaluation of different machine learning models for time-series forecasting (including recurrent neural networks and transformers), and the qualitative and quantitative assessment of resource reservation plans. A key focus will be showcasing the role of custom domain-specific evaluation measures and demonstrating their relationship with standard machine learning evaluation metrics, highlighting that the model best suited for forecasting may not always be the one that enables the most efficient dynamic resource reservation planning. Additionally, given the potential negative impacts and risks associated with applying machine learning, aspects related to monitoring and enhancing the interpretability of system detections are of key importance.  As cloud environments involve different types of virtual machines, the application of forecasting is considered in the context of both HPC (High-Performance Computing) machines and general-purpose ones, highlighting the differences in approaches between them. In environments dominated by general-purpose or diverse-purpose machines, not just those for long-running scientific workflows, the key to resource usage optimization may lie in focusing on optimizing the time-series forecasting process itself, enabling scalable optimization along with the dynamic evolution of environments. Ultimately, ML-based optimization represents a tradeoff between minimizing costs, maximizing resource utilization, and maintaining high service availability.

  title: "BATTLE-AMP - Benchmarking Assessment Tests for The Leading Efficacy of Antimicrobial Peptides"
  author-title: "Computational Medicine Group, MIMUW"
  abstract: >- 
    Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a promising alternative to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, they have not been widely adopted in clinic due to their high toxicity and low activity. Therefore, discriminative methods are crucial to select AMP candidates with desired properties. The comparison of predictive models in AMP discovery is challenging and lacks consistency due to the absence of  standardized benchmarks. New methods are evaluated on custom datasets that are often not related to key AMP properties such as activity and are typically released in a manner that is difficult to reproduce. In this work we reviewed over 50 methods for AMP prediction and observed that code reproducibility was a significant challenge, with only 10 methods meeting our criteria for reproducibility. To address this fundamental problem, we propose an extendable framework for the systematic comparison of AMP prediction methods. We evaluated the robustness of these methods in key biological contexts, such as activity against specific species or adversarial syntactic variations. Our framework ensures higher reproducibility and plug-and-play assessment of new models, aiming to redefine AMP classification in a way that aligns more closely with the biological context.

  title: "Statistical criteria for the prediction of dynamical clustering in granular gases"
  author-title: "Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"
  abstract: >- 
    Granular matter, which consists of ensembles of interacting macroscopic particles, plays a prominent role in many natural and industrial processes, such as cosmic body formation, processing of coal and ore in mining, etc. It is ubiquitous in our environment (e.g. sand, gravel) and takes great part in our daily life applications (salt, sugar, coffee beans, etc). While exhibiting their own unique properties, most granular materials can be roughly attributed to liquid state (as in case of hourglass), gaseous state (dust cloud) and solid state (e.g. clogged aggregation of particles). Granular gases are relatively sparse ensembles of free-moving macroscopic particles which interact mainly via inelastic collisions. One fascinating property of granular gas is the dynamical clustering, i.e. spontaneous local increase of particle density which leads to decrease of particle mobility. In order to understand dynamical clustering, experiments are performed in microgravity conditions and matching numerical models are developed.  Due to several disadvantages of direct numerical simulations such as higher computation time, machine learning based approaches provide a promising alternative to predict dynamical clustering. With the help of machine learning, a function that maps the input parameters of the system (number of particles, container size, etc.) to a variable that states whether the system is in the gaseous or cluster state can be built. With the help of this function, the state of the system for a given set of system parameters can be predicted without the need of extensive numerical simulations. In order to quantify the property of dynamical clustering in granular gases, several statistical criteria have been developed over recent years. Three such criteria include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (KS-Test), the so-called caging-effect that is based on the critical local packing fraction and analysis of local density distributions. We performed multiple numerical simulations based on the VIP-GRAN experiment and the clustering criteria were evaluated for various combinations of system parameters. These criteria were compared in order to investigate their advantages and drawbacks.  A dataset that contains system parameters and clustering criteria variables have been prepared, and several machine learning models were trained and validated using this dataset with the help of standard regression performance metrics. Based on the performance on these metrics, best models were identified for each of clustering criteria.
