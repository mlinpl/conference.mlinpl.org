  title: "Towards More Realistic Membership Inference Attacks on Large Diffusion Models"
  author-title: "Warsaw University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    Generative diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion
    and Midjourney, can generate visually appealing, diverse,
    and high-resolution images for various applications. These
    models are trained on billions of internet-sourced images,
    raising significant concerns about the potential unauthorized
    use of copyright-protected images. In this paper, we examine
    whether it is possible to determine if a specific image was
    used in the training set, a problem known in the cybersecurity community and referred to as a membership inference
    attack. Our focus is on Stable Diffusion, and we address
    the challenge of designing a fair evaluation framework to
    answer this membership question. We propose a new dataset
    to establish a fair evaluation setup and apply it to Stable
    Diffusion, also applicable to other generative models. With
    the proposed dataset, we execute membership attacks (both
    known and newly introduced). Our research reveals that
    previously proposed evaluation setups do not provide a full
    understanding of the effectiveness of membership inference
    attacks. We conclude that the membership inference attack
    remains a significant challenge for large diffusion models
    (often deployed as black-box systems), indicating that related
    privacy and copyright issues will persist in the foreseeable
    future.

  title: "Solver-free neural ordinary differential equations for forecasting long horizon time series"
  author-title: "NVIDIA / Universisty of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    Neural ordinary differential equations (NeuralODEs) represent a highly adaptable model class suitable for forecasting applications. Nonetheless, their training efficiency is often hampered by the sequential computation of a numerical solver, resulting in significantly longer training times compared to discrete forecasting methods like RNNs. To address this limitation, we propose employing multiple linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) within the latent space instead of arbitrary ODEs. Linear ODEs can be analytically solved in constant time through matrix exponentiation and it is possible to backpropagate through this operation, enabling the model to converge approximately an order of magnitude faster than NeuralODEs. Moreover, linear ODEs exhibit competitive predictive performance when compared to state of the art forecasting methods and offer, just like NeuralODEs, the advantage of being continuously evaluable at any timestamp.

  title: "Fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    Transformer-based Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, in many cases reaching, or even surpassing, human performance in Natural Language Understanding tasks. These models are typically backed up by a generous computational budget, size of dataset and parameter count. However, in many cases this scaling cannot be continued due to hardware limitations. This leads researchers and engineers to look for more efficient techniques. Among them, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) seems to give the most promising results, allowing to scale Language Models to up to a trillion parameters, and reaching state-of-the-art performance on many tasks. This is accompanied by a much lower need for computational power in comparison to classical Transformer models. Existing work only considers scaling up these models by adding more experts with the same size. This is limited due to the memory requirements and diminishing returns for higher model sizes. In our work we will consider increasing the number of experts, but keeping the amount of computation and parameter count constant. We will explain how to use this technique to train a Language Model to the same performance using 2 times fewer steps (compared with baseline MoE). We will also present other benefits that come from using our method.

  title: "GARAGE: Generative-Augmented Retrieval Assisting Generation Enhancement"
  author-title: "University of Warsaw"
  abstract: >- 
    With the recent rise in popularity of generative models (e.g. ChatGPT, GPT4) the issues with the accuracy of the provided information became a great threat. The models might generate a correct answer, but in many cases, they output with high confidence a totally wrong and extremely plausible answer. In many sectors, this hallucinating behavior can have critical consequences e.g. medicine, law, or engineering, and therefore the usage of generative models is very risky especially when people don't know the limitations of such tools. In this paper, we tackle a very important task of augmenting generative models like BART or ChatGPT to improve their capabilities of generating factual responses. Moreover, we incorporate a mechanism of providing passages containing information from a local knowledge database alongside the generated response. Thanks to such improvements the users get the possibility to quickly assess the correctness of a response and by relying on an external nonparametric knowledge-base memory it is easy to update the model's knowledge to provide correct answers. Our model consists of a powerful ensemble of classical and neural retrievers and generative prompt enhancement to achieve a superior performance of information retrieval. Our experiments employ the CovidQA dataset, which comprises questions and passages from scientific articles, to assess the performance of GARAGE. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline models in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer quality, while also reducing hallucinations typically encountered in large language models. The total cost of training the model and performing experiments was 10$ making it very affordable and compute resource efficient. GARAGE signifies a promising advancement in open-domain question answering systems and paves the way for future research in combining traditional retrieval methods with neural approaches.

  title: "Random Similarity Isolation Forest - Outlier Detection for Multimodal Data"
  author-title: "Poznan University of Technology"
  abstract: >- 
    To enhance the accuracy of predictive models, it is reasonable to gather as much data about the object of interest as possible. As a result, increasingly often, the collected data consists not only of simple numerical data but also more complex objects such as time series, images, sets, or graphs. Such multimodal representations provide many different points of view on the data and may improve performance. However, optimal use of these modalities is a challenging task, especially in outlier detection, where algorithms are dedicated to individual types of data. Consequently, working with mixed types of data requires either fusing multiple data-specific models or transforming all of the representations into a single format, both of which can hinder predictive performance.
    
    In this talk, we present a multi-modal outlier detection algorithm called Random Similarity Isolation Forest (RSIF), which, to our knowledge, is the first outlier detection method capable of handling mixed-type data inherently without converting it to a different representation. This method couples the efficiency and performance of the Isolation Forest with the similarity-based projections of a Random Similarity Forest. More precisely, having provided a distance measure for each feature, RSIF uses similarity-based projections to create a multimodal feature space for detecting outliers. In this space, the algorithm creates an ensemble of trees to find the most isolated data points.
    
    In addition to a comprehensive experimental evaluation on 37 datasets consisting of numerical, categorical, graph, time series, image, text, and multi-omics data, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to study the properties of the proposed algorithm. The sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that RSIF can be considered a generalization of Isolation Forests. More precisely, RSIF is capable of behaving exactly like Isolation Forests when it uses Euclidean distance on single features for projections but also offers more flexibility by being capable of using multiple complex distance measures for projections. Moreover, we propose a parameter that minimizes the number of distance calculations required by RSIF and show that it does not negatively impact predictive performance. To conclude the sensitivity analysis, for each data modality, we tested a variety of similarity functions. We show that selecting appropriate projections is crucial, especially in the context of an unsupervised algorithm such as RSIF. Finally, the experimental evaluation with the use of the AUC metric, showed that RSIF is equally good or significantly better than five competitor models: LOF, HBOS, ECOD, Similarity Forest, and Isolation Forest. Regardless of the data modality,  RSIF was always competitive. Our ongoing work focuses on translating these results into a practical application in the field of predictive maintenance.
    
    In our work, we tried to elaborate on similarity-based projection methods and their usage in multimodal outlier detection as thoroughly as possible. As a result, a new competitive algorithm - Random Isolation Similarity Forest - was introduced. Still, many exciting directions for future work, such as the potential for interpretability, the search for better similarity measures, the optimal way of selecting projection pairs, and the search for new multimodal outlier detection datasets, remain open. This is why, besides sharing our insights, we fully open-source our code and unique set of datasets.

  title: "Self-guided semantic segmentation"
  author-title: "University of Amsterdam"
  abstract: >- 
    While humans can recognize a virtually limitless variety of objects in context, automated segmentation systems typically rely on a fixed set of objects they have been trained to identify. Open-vocabulary segmentation methods, meant to address this issue, instead rely on a list of objects given by the user alongside the image. A truly open segmentation method should be able to name and localize different parts of the scene based on the image itself, without the need for user-provided labels or a predefined set of classes. To achieve this, we propose Self-guided Semantic Segmentation (SegSeg), a new framework for semantic segmentation, which combines open-vocabulary segmentation with a method of generating labels from the image itself. Utilizing ClusterBLIP, our newly introduced method based on the Vision-Language model BLIP, we successfully generate localized captions that comprehensively describe different parts of an image. These captions then serve as a source of labels for X-Decoder, an open-vocabulary segmentation model. To evaluate the performance in this new self-guided setting, we propose modifications to the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) that compares predicted and ground truth labels using text embedding similarities. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines that use image captioning in a more conventional manner, thereby making a significant contribution to the field of image segmentation and paving the way for future research in open-world vision systems.

  title: "Energy Storage in the Smart Grid: a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach"
  author-title: "University of Southampton"
  abstract: >- 
    This work presents a novel energy storage system controlled by a Reinforcement Learning agent for households in the context of smart grid technology. The proposed system aims to optimize electricity trading in variable tariff environment. The system has been shown through simulations and evaluations to generate significant consumer savings in electricity bills, up to 29.53%, without requiring changes in consumption habits. It also offers substantial earnings when combined with solar panels. My work further investigates a Multi-Agent System simulation to analyze interactions and identify beneficial price-demand relationships. The findings highlight the positive impact of storage on the energy market and demonstrate the advantages for both consumers and network operators. Deep Q Learning is identified as the most effective algorithm, and the study examines the effects of different storage sizes and agent complexity levels. The results provide valuable insights into the potential of the proposed solution and its benefits for the wider community.

  title: "Deep learning based distance estimation of galaxies"
  author-title: "Center For Theoretical Physics, Polish Academy Of Science"
  abstract: >- 
    One of the biggest challenges in astronomy is to measure distances to celestial objects. This is especially the case for far-away galaxies, which are millions and billions of light years from us. The traditional observational technique to measure galaxy distances is by obtaining their electromagnetic spectra - detailed decomposition of the light arriving to us - and computing the so-called redshift, related to the expansion of the Universe. However, exact redshifts can only be obtained for a small percentage of all observed galaxies. In the era of billions of galaxy samples, other techniques of distance estimation are being developed, and among them are those using machine learning to estimate the redshift from galaxy images at different “colors” - different electromagnetic wavelengths or frequencies. For many years now methods such as artificial neural networks have been used for that purpose, and they have relied on post-processed, summary information about galaxies, in the form of galaxy fluxes measured for the different colors. However, more precise information about galaxy distances can be extracted directly from their full images, which encode many features lost in the post-processing (“data reduction”). This is where deep learning techniques excel and in my talk, I will show how we employ convolutional neural networks to estimate redshifts from state-of-the-art observational data.
