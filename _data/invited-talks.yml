- title: Towards Real-World Fact-Checking with Large Language Models
  abstract: >-
    Misinformation poses a growing threat to our society. It has a severe impact on public health by promoting fake cures or vaccine hesitancy, and it is used as a weapon during military conflicts to spread fear and distrust. Current research on natural language processing (NLP) for fact-checking focuses on identifying evidence and predicting the veracity of a claim. People’s beliefs, however, often do not depend on the claim and rational reasoning but on credible content that makes the claim seem more reliable, such as scientific publications or visual content that was manipulated or stems from unrelated contexts. To combat misinformation, we need to show (1) “Why was the claim believed to be true?“, (2) “Why is the claim false?“, (3) “Why is the alternative explanation correct?“. In this talk, I will zoom in on two critical aspects of such misinformation supported by credible though misleading content. Firstly, I will present our efforts to dismantle misleading narratives based on fallacious interpretations of scientific publications. Secondly, I will show how we can use multimodal large language models to (1) detect misinformation based on visual content and (2) provide strong alternative explanations for the visual content.

- title: "Evolving programs with LLMs"
  abstract: >-
    In this talk I will present FunSearch, a method to search for new solutions in mathematics and computer science. FunSearch works by pairing a pre-trained LLM, whose goal is to provide creative solutions in the form of computer code, with an automated “evaluator”, which guards against hallucinations and incorrect ideas. By iterating back-and-forth between these two components, initial solutions “evolve” into new knowledge. I will present the application of FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics — the cap set problem — where we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This represents the first discoveries made for established open problems using LLMs. Then, I will present the application of FunSearch to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, which showcases the generality of the method. In this use case, FunSearch finds new heuristics that improve upon widely used baselines. I will conclude the talk by discussing the implications of searching in the space of code.

- title: "Explainable AI for LLMs"
  abstract: >-
    Large Language Models are prone to biased predictions and hallucinations, underlining the paramount importance of understanding their model-internal reasoning process. However, achieving faithful explanations for the entirety of a black-box transformer model and maintaining computational efficiency is difficult. This talk will present a recent extension of the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) attribution method to handle attention layers, which addresses this challenge effectively. Our method is the first to faithfully and holistically attribute not only input but also latent representations of transformer models with the computational efficiency similar to a singular backward pass. Since the LRP is a model-aware XAI method, it not only identifies the relevant features in input space (e.g., pixels or words) but also provides deep insights into the model’s representation and the reasoning process. Through extensive evaluations against existing methods on Llama 2, Flan-T5 and the Vision Transformer architecture, we demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses alternative methods in terms of faithfulness and enables the understanding of latent representations, opening up the door for concept-based explanations.

  abstract: >-
    Touch is a crucial sensor modality in both humans and robots. Recent advances in tactile sensing hardware have resulted -- for the first time -- in the availability of mass-produced, high-resolution, inexpensive, and reliable tactile sensors. In this talk, I will argue for the importance of creating a new computational field of "Touch processing" dedicated to the processing and understanding of touch through the use of Artificial Intelligence. This new field will present significant challenges both in terms of research and engineering, but also significantly opportunities in digitizing a new sensing modality. To conclude, I will present some applications of touch in robotics and discuss other future applications.

    For the first time, we’re sharing the story behind Molecule.One. Founded in 2018 to make making medicines faster, we built the first generative deep learning product for chemistry. We battled — as early as in 2019 — problems that we know understand as hallucination and alignment. We then almost went under. We raised back building the most comprehensive reaction dataset in our highly automated laboratory, just to face another almost fatal adversity. In the process, we found ourselves immersed in a broader and sweeping change in the AI landscape. We offer a candid look at ups and downs, distilling insights and giving broader predictions about the future of AI-first companies.

- title: Inductive Biases for Robot Reinforcement Learning
  abstract: >-
    Autonomous robots that can assist humans in situations of daily life have been a long standing vision of robotics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive sciences. A first step towards this goal is to create robots that can learn tasks triggered by environmental context or higher level instruction. However, learning techniques have yet to live up to this promise as only few methods manage to scale to high-dimensional manipulator or humanoid robots. In this talk, we investigate a general framework suitable for learning motor skills in robotics which is based on the principles behind many analytical robotics approaches. To accomplish robot reinforcement learning learning from just few trials, the learning system can no longer explore all learn-able solutions but has to prioritize one solution over others – independent of the observed data. Such prioritization requires explicit or implicit assumptions, often called ‘induction biases’ in machine learning. Extrapolation to new robot learning tasks requires induction biases deeply rooted in general principles and domain knowledge from robotics, physics and control. Empirical evaluations on a several robot systems illustrate the effectiveness and applicability to learning control on an anthropomorphic robot arm. These robot motor skills range from toy examples (e.g., paddling a ball, ball-in-a-cup) to playing robot table tennis, juggling and manipulation of various objects.

- title: "RLHF as conditioning on human preferences"
  abstract: >-
    The dominant approach to aligning large language models with human preferences is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): finetuning an LLM to maximise a reward function representing human preferences. In this talk, I will try to present a complementary perspective: that we can also think about LLM alignment not in terms of reward maximisation but in terms of conditioning LMs on evidence about human preferences. First, I will explain how minimizing the classic RLHF objective is equivalent to approximate Bayesian inference. Then, I will go on to argue that the conditioning view also inspires other approaches to LLM alignment. I will discuss three: minimising different f-divergences from a target distribution, learning from feedback expressed in natural language and aligning LMs already during pretraining by directly learning a distribution conditional on alignment score. I will end the talk discussing how they correspond to conditioning subsequent priors on subsequent pieces of evidence about human preferences.

- title: "Unveiling the Potential of AI-enabled In-silico Trials in Medical Innovation"
  abstract: >-
    The rapid introduction of novel medical technologies necessitates swift, reliable scientific validation of their safety and efficacy to protect patient welfare. Traditional clinical trials, while essential, face challenges such as detecting low-frequency side effects, high costs, and practical limitations, especially with paediatric patients, rare diseases, and underrepresented ethnic groups. In-silico trials (IST), powered by Computational Medicine, offer a promising solution by using computer simulations to test medical products on virtual patient populations. This approach allows for the a-priori optimisation of clinical outcomes, thorough risk assessment, and failure mode analysis before human trials. Although in-silico evidence is still emerging, it has the potential to revolutionise health and life sciences R&D and regulatory processes.

Depending on the audience's familiarity, I may spend most of the time covering the way these modalities are integrated via SigLIP, CapPa, and PaLI, as well as touch on some fairness and cultural diversity aspects ("No Filter" paper), or spend more time on the advanced way in which classically "typical vision" tasks such as detection, segmentation, monocular depth, are finding their way into VLMs and the standard language-modeling approach, covering UViM, RL-tuning, GIVT, and more recent approaches towards fully end-to-end multimodal learning.

- title: Improving Foundation Models (with academic compute)
  abstract: >-
    I will talk about how we can build on top of pretrained Foundation Models to achieve better models for vision, language, audio and multi-modal tasks. First I will show that despite its strong performance, DINOv2 and other vision backbones often lack spatial understanding of images. To counteract this, we use NeCo, a new post-pretraining approach based on patch-nearest neighbors, which significantly improves the dense performances of this and any other model despite using only 16 GPU hours. Next I will introduce two parameter-efficient finetuning methods for LLMs and for VLMs that significantly reduce the amount of parameters required for successfully tuning these models. Finally, I will present our latest work, where we show that gradients from self-supervised losses can be successfully used as features for improved retrieval performances across vision, audio and text.
