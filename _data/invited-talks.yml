- title: "Understanding Iterative Magnitude Pruning: linear mode connectivity, symmetries, and data"
  abstract: >-
    Magnitude-based neural network pruning is an effective and widely used technique for compressing neural networks. In this talk I will present my line of work investigating iterative magnitude pruning. I will discuss how the data used to train and prune as well as algorithmic aspects of pruning itself, affect generalization. Using a toy model, I will illustrate how pruning interacts with the loss landscape and curvature.  Finally, I will describe linear mode connectivity's role in iterative magnitude pruning and present our recent findings on how symmetries in neural networks affect iterative magnitude pruning and lottery tickets.

- title: Learning Dynamical Systems Via Koopman Operator Regression
  abstract: >-
    Non-linear dynamical systems can be handily described by the associated Koopman operator, whose action evolves every observable of the system forward in time. These operators are instrumental to forecasting and interpreting the system dynamics, and have broad applications in science and engineering. The talk gives a gentle introduction to this topic, with a focus on theory and algorithms. We highlight the importance of algorithms that allow us to estimate the spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator well and explore how the quest for good representations for these operators can be formulated as an optimization problem involving neural networks.

- title: Language Modelling with Pixels
  abstract: >-
    Language models are usually defined over a finite set of inputs, which creates a bottleneck if we attempt to scale the number of languages supported by a model. Tackling this bottleneck often results in a trade-off between what can be represented in the model and computational issues in the output layer. I will present the Pixel-based Encoder of Language, which suffers from neither of these issues by rendering text as images, making it possible to transfer representations across languages based on the co-activation of pixels. I will discuss the results of various models, pretrained on only English text, ranging from just 5M parameters up to 86M parameters on a variety of downstream syntactic and semantic tasks in 32 typologically diverse languages across 14 scripts.

- title: Teaching Language Models to Use Tools
  abstract: >-
    Large language models (LLMs) have fueled dramatic progress in natural language tasks and are already at the core of many user-facing products, such as ChatGPT and Copilot. Paradoxically, language models often still struggle with basic tasks, like solving simple arithmetic problems, where smaller and simpler external resources, such as a calculator, can accomplish the task perfectly. This talk will focus on LLMs that leverage external resources, beginning with models that are always prompted to use an external tool, like retrieval-augmented models. The second part of this talk will concentrate on teaching models to autonomously understand how and when to leverage tools in a self-supervised way. Finally, we will discuss exciting new opportunities that necessitate external tool usage.

- title: Planning and Learning in Structured Environments
  abstract: >-
    Reinforcement learning (RL) and more generally sequential decision making deal with problems where the decision maker ('agent') needs to take actions over time. While impressive results have been achieved on challenging domains like Atari, Go, and Starcraft, most of this work relies on neural networks to form their own internal abstractions. However, in many applications, we may be able to exploit some knowledge about the structure of the environment to guide this process.  In this talk I will cover some of my work that tries to exploit structure to define effective methods for planning and reinforcement learning.

- title: Importance-Weighted Offline Learning Done Right
  abstract: >-
    We study the problem of offline policy optimization in stochastic
    contextual bandit problems, where the goal is to learn a near-optimal
    policy based on a dataset of decision data collected by a suboptimal
    behavior policy. Rather than making any structural assumptions on the
    reward function, we assume access to a given policy class and aim to
    compete with the best comparator policy within this class. In this
    setting, a standard approach is to compute importance-weighted
    estimators of the value of each policy, and select a policy that
    minimizes the estimated value up to a "pessimistic" adjustment
    subtracted from the estimates to reduce their random fluctuations. In
    this paper, we show that a simple alternative approach based on the
    "implicit exploration" estimator of Neu (2015) yields performance
    guarantees that are superior in nearly all possible terms to all
    previous results. Most notably, we remove an extremely restrictive
    "uniform coverage" assumption made in all previous works. These
    improvements are made possible by the observation that the upper and
    lower tails importance-weighted estimators behave very differently
    from each other, and their careful control can massively improve on
    previous results that were all based on symmetric two-sided
    concentration inequalities. We also extend our results to infinite
    policy classes in a PAC-Bayesian fashion, and showcase the robustness
    of our algorithm to the choice of hyper-parameters by means of
    numerical simulations.

- title: "Geometric Algebra Transformers: A Universal Architecture for Geometric Data"
  abstract: >-
    Problems involving geometric data arise in a variety of fields, including computer vision, robotics, chemistry, and physics. Such data can take numerous forms, such as points, direction vectors, planes, or transformations, but to date there is no single architecture that can be applied to such a wide variety of geometric types while respecting their symmetries. In this paper we introduce the Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr), a general-purpose architecture for geometric data. GATr represents inputs, outputs, and hidden states in the projective geometric algebra, which offers an efficient 16-dimensional vector space representation of common geometric objects as well as operators acting on them. GATr is equivariant with respect to Pin(3,0,1), the double cover of E(3): the symmetry group of 3D Euclidean space. As a transformer, GATr is scalable, expressive, and versatile. In various geometric problems, GATr shows strong improvements over non-geometric baselines.

- title: Neural Network Deployment - Dealing with Non-Differentiable Objectives and with Prior Shift
  abstract: >-
    The talk will touch two problems that are common, yet rarely addressed, in the deployment of system based on neural networks.
    
    
    The natural formulations of many tasks, in computer vision and elsewhere, leads to a non-differentiable objective function, rendering  standard SGD training inapplicable. In applicatons, the problem is often side-stepped by using a differentiable proxy loss, i.e. a loss designed for another task, which may or may not align well with the non-differentiable objective. We will present approaches for learning a differentiable surrogate of  decomposable and non-differentiable objectives.  For the decomposable case, the approach is validated on two practical tasks of scene text recognition and detection, where the surrogate learns an approximation of edit distance and intersection-over-union, respectively. For the non-decomposable case, we consider image retrieval and develop a recall@k surrogate, also applicable for sorting and counting.
    

    The second part of the talk will focus on the problem of prior shift, i.e. the situation when the the training and test data have different prior probabilities, distinguishing two cases, when the test-time priors is known and when it must be estimated. The proposed method treats the outputs of the deep net as  a posteriori probabilities, requiring output calibration. The benefits of test-time prior estimation and adaptation will be demonstrated on a fine-grained recognition problem.

- title: Modular Deep Learning for Customisable LLMs
  abstract: >- 
    Large Language Models (LLMs) are fine-tuned on instructions and/or human feedback to create general-purpose models for a variety of AI applications. Nevertheless, LLMs are hard to customise due to their scale, which makes full fine-tuning impractical (due to its high memory requirements) and prompting unreliable (due to its inferior performance). How then to customise the behaviour of an LLM efficiently? Modular deep learning has emerged as an alternative paradigm where information is routed to specialised, autonomous modules. Individual modules can be subsequently merged to add (or subtract) the knowledge they contain from a backbone LLM.

    A module may consist of any form of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) so that large inventories of modules do not impact the complexity of the original LLM. However, most PEFT methods suffer from interferences when multiple modules are activated. Hence, I propose a series of algorithms to create composable modules. In particular, I will show how to adapt LLMs by updating only sub-networks (subsets of parameters): the resulting modules consist of sparse parameter shifts from the dense LLM, which can be composed in non-destructive ways.

    Composing modules is crucial for generalising systematically to new tasks when these consist of new combinations of skills learned from previous tasks. While sometimes the required skills are known (e.g., language modules and task modules in cross-lingual transfer), often it is necessary to learn how to route every input to the modules corresponding to the skills needed to solve it. To this end, I will illustrate a method to disentangle skills into modules and routing to variable-size subsets of skills in both NLP and RL.

    Finally, I will show how adding modules can promote positive behaviours in LLMs (e.g., faithfulness to ground-truth knowledge) and how subtracting modules can discourage negative behaviours (e.g., toxicity). Moreover, I will demonstrate that the errors resulting from these merging operations stem from the mismatch between the gradients of individual modules and a “target” model (by definition inaccessible) trained on the union of their data. Thus, I will provide a general formula for merging modules that minimises their gradient mismatch.

- title: Game Theory Empowered by Data Science and Machine learning to Improve Treatment of Metastatic Cancer
  abstract: >-
    Standard of care in metastatic cancers typically applies Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD) of treatment or treatment combinations, either continuously or in repeated identical cycles, until unacceptable toxicity, cancer progression, or cure. Cure is rare, due to fast evolving therapy resistance. My recent research helped to explain why MTD fails and to design first evolutionary  anti-cancer therapies, i.e. therapies that anticipate and forestall evolution of  treatment-induced resistance in cancer cells. Such therapies can be designed through Stackelberg evolutionary games (SEGs), i.e. games between a rational leader (here physician) and evolutionary followers (here evolving cancer cells). I will demonstrate how data science and machine learning can empower game theory to design the evolutionary anti-cancer therapies and how such therapies lead to better quality and quantity of patients’ lives.
