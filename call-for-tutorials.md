The **{{ site.inline-logo }}** is inviting proposals for tutorials on core machine learning topics or emerging areas of significance for machine learning. Tutorials should be self-contained, covering necessary background material, and demonstrate their importance to the ML in PL community.

Only research institutions are eligible to submit tutorial proposals. Tutorials should reflect the wider machine learning research, not solely focus on presenters or their organizations. They should provide a balanced overview of the research area, including both known results and open problems.

**Each tutorial can be a maximum of 4 hours long, including Q&A.** Approximately 10 tutorials will be selected, divided into two sessions (morning and afternoon). **The tutorials will be held on-site at the Warsaw University of Technology on October 29, 2023**. For each accepted tutorial, we will provide two free tickets for the conference.

The proposal deadline is 20 August 2023. To submit a proposal, please visit the submission form:
