            <p>
                The {{ page.mlinpl-inline-logo }} (formerly PL in ML) is a non-archival scientific conference on machine learning research 
                and applications, organized by non-profit ML in PL Association. 
                It is held annually in Warsaw, Poland. Ever since its inauguration in 2017, 
                the conference has been gathering a diverse audience of machine learning researchers and enthusiasts, 
                providing them with a platform to listen to the leading experts in the field, present and discuss their latest research,
                and meet like-minded machine learning enthusiasts in a friendly and inclusive atmosphere.

                {{ page.mlinpl-inline-logo }} would not exist without 
                presentations of our community members.
                Each year we invite all to submit their talks and poster proposals.
                We receive a multitude of high-quality submissions 
                and accept the best proposals to be presented at the conference.
                We aim to provide a forum for discussing recent advances from 
                the possible broadest range of topics and perspectives.
                Because of that, our selection process focuses on inclusivity, 
                embracing a wide range of themes and viewpoints. 
                In addition to scientific excellence, we consider the relevance, novelty,

                ML in PL Association is a non-profit organization set up by students from Poland that wanted to have 
                a world-class machine learning conference in their country, so they decided to organize it themselves.
                The association consists of a group of volunteers, mostly undergrad, graduate, and PhD students, 
                that are devoted to fostering the machine learning community in Poland and Europe 
                and promoting a deep understanding of machine learning.

            <p>
                Despite the conference being organized by volunteers in their free time, 
                the years of experience, well-defined structure of the management,
                and knowledge transfer between senior and junior members of the association
                ensure mostly smooth organization of a large-scale international event, which is {{ page.mlinpl-inline-logo }}.
            </p>
            <p>
                100% of the profits from the conference are used to support the organization of the next editions of ML in PL Conference and our Machine Learning Summer Schools.
