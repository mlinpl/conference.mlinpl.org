## / About the Call for Talks and Posters

We believe in the inclusive nature of machine learning research and aim to provide a forum for a discussion on recent advances in the field. Whether you're an academic, a seasoned practitioner, or a student, we encourage you to share your work at the Conference. We welcome submissions broadly related to machine learning and its application across various other domains.

**The talks at the Main Conference should have a length of 20 minutes + 5 minutes for questions. For the poster presentation, we will hold two 1.5-hour sessions during the 2nd and 3rd day of the conference. Student Research Workshop talks should take around 15 minutes + 5 minutes for questions.** To participate in the Call for Contributions, we please provide the title of your talk/poster proposal, an abstract of up to 300 words, your preference towards talk or poster, a short bio, a photo, and a list of your previous talks. Talks and posters should be in English. The submission deadline is 31 August 2024. With the help of the Contributions Committee, we will select the best proposals.

## / Acceptance criteria

The factors that will be considered the most when evaluating submissions include:
- The relevance of the proposed topic in the current machine learning landscape.
- Novelty and uniqueness of the proposed topic. Even if your topic does not fall into any listed areas, do not feel discouraged to submit it! Also, interdisciplinary topics are especially highly encouraged!
- Enjoyable by our audience: a good balance between accessibility and scientific excellence.
- For talk proposals, we will take into account the author’s speaking experience, however, it does not mean that we will reject all inexperienced speakers.
- Talks/posters proposals with clear promotion of the commercial products will be rejected. 

All accepted talks and posters will be presented during the Main Conference (or the Student Research Workshop). 
**The presenting author (the one submitting the application) will receive a free ticket.** 
The co-authors of accepted papers will have a guaranteed option to buy the tickets with the Early Bird prices.
