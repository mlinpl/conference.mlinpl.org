## About the Call for Contributions

We believe that anyone can make a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning, and in our eyes, an important contribution is not necessarily the most novel research. Therefore we wish to bring together a broad array of researchers, specialists, practitioners, educators, students, and others of diverse backgrounds, locations, and genders to present their work at the conference. 

We aim at providing a forum for discussing recent advances from the possible broadest range of topics and perspectives, we especially encourage (but not limit) submissions related to the following topics of interest:
1. **General Machine Learning**: Active Learning, Classification, Clustering, Learning Theory, Online Learning, Ranking, Regression, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised learning, Optimization, Sparsity, etc.
2. **Deep Learning**: Architectures, Generative Models, Optimization for Deep Networks, Recurrent Networks, etc.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Bandits, Decision and Control, Exploration, Hierarchical RL, Markov Decision Processes, Multi-Agent RL, Navigation, Planning, etc.
4. **Probabilistic Methods**: Bayesian methods, Causal Inference, Gaussian Processes, Graphical Models, etc.
5. **Applications of Machine Learning**: Audio and Speech Processing, Computational Biology, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Robotics, Neuroscience, Physics, Social Good, etc.
6. **Social Aspects of Machine Learning**: Accountability, AI Ethics, AI Safety, Causality, Biased Data, Fairness, Privacy, Robustness, and Safety, etc.
7. **Explainable Machine Learning**: Interpretability and Explainability of Machine Learning Models, Methods for Understanding and Explaining Model Decisions, Techniques for Building Transparent and Understandable AI Systems, Human-AI Interaction, etc.
8. **Technical Solutions and Machine Learning Resources**: Architectures, Competitions, Data Sets and Repositories, Distributed Machine Learning, Implementations, Software Toolkits, etc.
9. **Machine Learning Stories**: Interesting and insightful competitions, projects, and start-up stories!

**The talks will have a length of 20 minutes + 5 minutes for questions for contributed talks at the Main Conference and 15 minutes + 5 minutes for questions for the Student Research Workshop**. To participate in the Call for Contributions, we ask you to provide the title of your talk/poster proposal, an abstract of up to 300 words, your preference towards talk or poster, a short bio, a photo, and a list of your previous talks. Talks and posters should be in English. The submission deadline is 1 September 2023. With the help of the Contributions Committee, we will select the best proposals. 


## Acceptance criteria

The factors that will be considered the most when evaluating submissions include:
- The relevance of the proposed topic in the current machine learning landscape.
- Novelty and uniqueness of the proposed topic. Even if your topic does not fall into any listed areas, do not feel discouraged to submit it! Also, interdisciplinary topics are especially highly encouraged!
- Enjoyable by our audience: a good balance between accessibility and scientific excellence.
- For talk proposals, we will take into account the authorâ€™s speaking experience, however, it does not mean that we will reject all inexperienced speakers.
- Talks/posters proposals with clear promotion of the commercial products will be rejected. 

All accepted talks and posters will be presented during the Main Conference (or the Student Research Workshop). 
**The presenting author (the one submitting the application) will receive a free ticket.** 
The co-authors will have a guaranteed option of buying a ticket in early bird, provided they fill the form in advance.
**Even if your proposal is not accepted, you will have the oportunity to buying a ticket for early bird price.**
