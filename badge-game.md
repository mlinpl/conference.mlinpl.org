## / About

The **full names of the participants** have been mapped to **two symbols - <i class="fa-solid fa-chess" style="font-size:20px"></i> and <i class="fa-solid fa-dna" style="font-size:20px"></i>**, which are printed on their badges. The mapping function is a puzzle, but it can be solved by collecting name-symbol pairs to **find a pattern**. As with any machine learning problem, the more data you have, the better your chances of solving it.

## / Rules

The rules are simple - collect as much data as possible and find the mapping function to accurately predict the symbols for the ten names in the test set. The **first five participants** who successfully predict all the symbols for the test set names will win prizes.
You can **network with other attendees** to collect their names and symbols or **visit sponsor booths to collect extra data points** that will help you solve the mapping function.

The assigned symbols are printed on the back of the badges, so you can ask participants to show them.

## / Hints

Don't worry if you can't find the pattern right away â€” after each day we will provide hints to guide you in solving the mapping function. But remember, the faster you solve the puzzle, the higher your chances of winning.
