## / About

The **full name of each participant** has been mapped to **two symbols - O and X**, which are printed on his badge. The mapping function is a puzzle, but it can be solved by collecting the names of other participants and their corresponding symbols to **find the  pattern**.

## / Rules

The rules are simple - collect as much data as possible to decode the mapping function and accurately predict the symbols for the names in the test set. The **first five participants** who successfully predict all the symbols for the test set names will win prizes.
You can network with other attendees to collect their names and symbols or **visit sponsor booths to collect extra data points** that will help you solve the mapping function.

## / Hints

Don't worry if you can't find the pattern right away â€” after each day we will provide hints to guide you in solving the mapping function. But remember, the faster you solve the puzzle, the higher your chances of winning.
