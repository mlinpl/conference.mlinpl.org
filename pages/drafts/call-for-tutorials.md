The **{{ site.inline-logo }}** is inviting proposals for tutorials on core machine learning topics or emerging areas of significance for machine learning. Tutorials should be self-contained, covering necessary background material, and demonstrate their importance to the ML in PL community.

Only research institutions are eligible to submit tutorial proposals. Tutorials with a clear marketing purpose will not be accepted. Tutorials should reflect the wider machine learning research, not solely focus on presenters or their organizations. They should provide a balanced overview of the research area, including both known results and open problems.

**Each tutorial can be a maximum of 4 hours long, including Q&A.** Approximately 10 tutorials will be selected, divided into two sessions (morning and afternoon). **The tutorials will be held on-site on 10 November 2024**. For each accepted tutorial, we will provide two free tickets for the conference.

The proposal deadline is 31 August 2024. To submit a proposal, please visit the submission form:
