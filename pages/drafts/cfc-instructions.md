## / Instructions for Contributed Talks

- All talks should be held in English.
- All the talks will have a length of 20 minutes + 5 minutes for questions. Please prepare your talk accordingly so that it is within the time limit.
- The talks will be grouped into sessions with 3 talks per session. The exact time, order of talks, and room for each session will be announced in the conference program.
- To avoid technical difficulties, this year, we will ask you to provide the slides before the session in the form of a PDF file or a link to your slides (e.g., Google Slides, PowerPoint Online, Canva). We will upload them to our conference computer and make sure that everything works smoothly. 
- Please be 5-10 minutes before the start of the session in the room where your talk will be held to meet the session chair and test the slides.
- In cases when the presentation requires specific software, please contact us in advance.
- The slide switcher will be available for you to use during the session.


## / Instructions for Contributed Posters

- All the posters should be in English.
- The participants are expected to bring their posters. **We will not print the posters for the participants.**
- The printed version of the poster has to be A0-size in a vertical orientation (recommended) or smaller. Larger posters will not fit on the poster boards.
- There will be poster sessions during the conference. Your poster will be assigned to one of them and a specific poster board.
- Please be at least 5-10 minutes before the start of the session in the room where your poster presentation will be held to hang it on the designated poster board. We don't know yet, but it might be possible to hang your poster earlier.
- The posters need to be removed at the end of the session. Posters that are not removed will be discarded.


### / Tips for preparing a poster

Those of you for whom this will be their first poster session might find it a bit intimidating. There are many tools that facilitate poster creation (e.g., LaTeX/Beamer, Powerpoint, Keynote). Our number-one pick is LaTeX due to its flexibility and compatibility with scientific papers. A good place to start might be the Overleaf poster gallery: [https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/poster](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/poster) There, you will find many templates for your poster. Also, if you are a student, ask your supervisor for the template by your organization.

Despite the selected tool, try to follow these simple rules:
- Simplicity is the key to easy understanding by your audience.
- Less is more – don't try to fill as much text as possible. Your poster should read like a good story, not a detailed manuscript.
- Highlight the most important parts of your poster for the best effectiveness.
- Remember that typically, viewers will only dedicate at most a few minutes to read a single poster. What is it that they should really learn about your work in that time?
- Use large-enough fonts and high-contrast colors. The text should be readable from a distance of 1-2 meters.

 
### / Tips from our scientific board

> *I typically start working on the poster with a set of images that will catch passer-by's attention. I try to fill at least 50% of the paper with graphics: visual examples, diagrams and graphs, as these are much easier to digest for the readers. They should convey the main message, i.e. looking at the graphics only, you should be able to understand what the poster is about. Remember that people look at the top of the poster to read the title first and then they reach down to the central part of the poster. This is where your .shiniest, prettiest graphics should sit!*

> *The aim of your poster is to make the your viewer curious. It should present a catching story, a big idea you want to "sell". Do not be worried about telling only part of the story. The poster is not meant to be self-contained, once the viewer is attracted it did its job to foster interactions between you and the reader. Then it is your turn as a presenter to make the viewer even more curious.*

> *At a poster session, the easiest way to find an interesting collaborator, advisor, employer is to show what you are interested in - you will surely find many like-minded people among your audience! Think about projects that you had at university or for private companies or just some for-fun projects.*

> *I like bulletpointed posters with keywords in bold. Your poster is not an essay - it's rather an elevator pitch of your brilliant idea. It doesn't have to disclose all the technical details including your learning rate parameter or batch size, it should rather intrigue the reader into reaching out and asking "that sounds like an exciting idea, can you tell me a bit more?"*
